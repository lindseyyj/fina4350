PHILADELPHIA -- Outrage is mounting after two men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks, and an eyewitness said a manager escalated the situation by calling police instead of asking the men to buy something or leave.

Lauren, who asked that her last name not be used, shot video of the two men being arrested at the Starbucks just before 5 p.m. on April 12. She said the incident began after the men asked to use the bathroom and were told that it was only available for paying customers, which Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross later confirmed.

After the men had been ""quietly hanging out, chatting and waiting for their friend,"" she said officers entered the restaurant and asked the two men to leave, saying that they would be trespassing if they did not leave.

""The two young men politely asked why they were being told to leave and were not given a reason other than the manager wanted them to leave,"" she told ABC in an email.

The men told the officer that they were waiting for a friend to arrive and offered to call that friend to prove that they had legitimate business at the restaurant, she said.

At that point, she said several officers began to move tables and chairs around the two men and take them into custody.

The friend for whom the men were waiting then arrived and attempted to intervene, but police told him the men ""were not paying customers and thus were trespassing,"" Lauren recalled.

""The two men stayed calm and did not raise their voices once. Everyone else in the Starbucks, however, was appalled,"" she added.

Lauren said another woman had entered the Starbucks minutes before the men were arrested and was given the bathroom code without having to buy anything and that another person in the restaurant at the time of the incident ""announced that she had been sitting at Starbucks for the past couple of hours without buying anything.""

""These men were discriminated against and unjustly detained. Being a person of privilege, it's hard to believe things like this still happen in 2018,"" Lauren told ABC. ""Sometimes you don't fully believe it until you see it with your own eyes.""

The Philadelphia Police Department has launched an internal investigation into the incident, and Commissioner Richard Ross has said the officers had legal standing to arrest the men because Starbucks, the property owner, had asked to have them removed from their private property.

The men were eventually released from police custody, and the district attorney's office declined to press charges due to a ""lack of evidence that a crime was committed.""

Starbucks has since released a statement apologizing to the two men, adding that they are ""disappointed this led to an arrest"" and pledging to review their policies ""to ensure these types of situations never happen in any of our stores."""
https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/4/14/17238494/what-happened-at-starbucks-black-men-arrested-philadelphia,Two black men were arrested in a Philadelphia Starbucks for doing nothing,14/04/2018,https://www.vox.com,"Two black men were arrested and escorted out of a Philadelphia Starbucks on Thursday after staff called the police to report they refused to leave; the men hadn‚Äôt ordered anything and were reportedly waiting for a business associate to arrive. The staff reportedly called 911 because Starbucks does ‚Äúnot allow nonpaying people from the public to come in and use the restroom,‚Äù Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross told the Philadelphia Inquirer. The employees said the men were trespassing and had refused to leave the restaurant.

A video of the incident has swept across the internet and sparked widespread outrage, prompting Starbucks to issue a less-than-satisfying apology on Saturday afternoon. CEO Kevin Johnson issued a lengthy statement on the incident on Saturday evening and said he wants to meet personally with the men arrested to apologize.

The saga began when a video posted on Twitter on Tuesday showed police arresting two black men in Twitter for ‚Äúdoing nothing,‚Äù in the words of the user who posted the video. Two people ‚Äî not the men ‚Äî can be heard protesting as the police remove the men‚Äôs chairs and escort them out. ‚ÄúThis is ridiculous,‚Äù one white man says to an officer in the video. The men do not protest.

The video has been viewed more than three and a half million times on Twitter since Thursday.

@Starbucks The police were called because these men hadn‚Äôt ordered anything. They were waiting for a friend to show up, who did as they were taken out in handcuffs for doing nothing. All the other white ppl are wondering why it‚Äôs never happened to us when we do the same thing. pic.twitter.com/0U4Pzs55Ci ‚Äî Melissa DePino (@missydepino) April 12, 2018

Police responded to the call and to keep things from ‚Äúgetting out of hand,‚Äù he said, and asked the men to leave, as Starbucks did not want them there. Ross defended the officers, saying they ‚Äúdid absolutely nothing wrong,‚Äù but the police department said it was conducting an ‚Äúinternal investigation.‚Äù

We are aware of an incident that occurred on 4-12-18 at the Starbucks Caf√© at 18th and Spruce. The entire incident, including the actions of the responding officers, is under internal investigation. Once we gather all the facts, we will comment further. ‚Äî Philadelphia Police (@PhillyPolice) April 14, 2018

There are a lot of questions here, and they‚Äôre not just about the police.

The video of the incident shows at least six police officers taking the two men into custody ‚Äî a high number, given they were doing nothing.

The obvious question: Beyond the police‚Äôs response, why were they called in the first place? People meet in Starbucks all the time, and they wait for others in the restaurant before ordering. Starbucks issued an apology on Saturday to the ‚Äútwo individuals and our customers‚Äù and said the company is ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù that it led to an arrest. ‚ÄúWe are reviewing our policies and will continue to engage with the community and the police department to try to ensure these types of situation never happen in any of our stores,‚Äù the statement says.

We apologize to the two individuals and our customers for what took place at our Philadelphia store on Thursday. pic.twitter.com/suUsytXHks ‚Äî Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) April 14, 2018

Johnson in a longer statement released on Saturday evening reiterated the apology and said the company plans to investigate the incident and ‚Äúmake any necessary changes to our practices that would help prevent such an occurrence from ever happening again.‚Äù He said Starbucks is ‚Äúfirmly against discrimination or racial profiling‚Äù and that he hopes to meet the men ‚Äúto offer a face-to-face apology.‚Äù

A second video from the Thursday incident posted on YouTube shows an extended version of what happened. The two black men who are ultimately arrested speak calmly to police. A third man, later identified real estate developer Andrew Yaffe, who is white, appears and protests.

‚ÄúDoes anybody else think this is ridiculous?‚Äù he asks, calling it ‚Äúabsolute discrimination.‚Äù Yaffee spoke with attorney Lauren Wimmer about the incident, and she talked to the Philadelphia Inquirer. ‚ÄúHe was meeting with the two gentlemen at the Starbucks to discuss business,‚Äù Wimmer said Saturday, identifying Yaffe as a friend. ‚ÄúThese two guys are business professionals in commercial real estate.‚Äù

Wimmer is representing the men who were arrested, who have not been identified publicly. She told the Inquirer she believes the reason for the arrest was ‚Äúcompletely based on race‚Äù and noted there was ‚Äúno indication any crime was being committed.‚Äù

Starbucks is not the first major restaurant chain to come under fire for racial discrimination. In 1994, Denny‚Äôs agreed to pay more than $54 million to settle racial discrimination lawsuits; in 2004, Cracker Barrel paid $8.7 million in discrimination lawsuits.

A video that's now amassed almost 7 million views on Twitter depicts police officers handcuffing two black men in a Philadelphia Starbucks.

Onlookers in the background are incredulous.

""What did they do?"" one man asks.

""They didn't do anything,"" a woman responds. ""I saw the entire thing.""

In a video statement streamed on Facebook Live from the Philadelphia Police Department's page, Commissioner Richard Ross confirmed that on Thursday afternoon at 4:40 p.m., Philadelphia police received a 911 call from the Starbucks at 18th and Spruce Streets alleging disturbance and trespassing.

When police arrived, two Starbucks employees told them two men had asked to use the restroom but were told they couldn't because they hadn't purchased anything. The men allegedly refused to leave after being asked by Starbucks employees. Ross also said the two men refused to leave after being asked three times by police officers.

So, Ross says, officers arrested the men. The attorney for the two men, Lauren Wimmer, told the Philadelphia Inquirer she received word that the two were being released from custody at 12:30 a.m. Friday, nearly eight hours after the initial 911 call. Ross confirmed that the officers released the men from custody after they discovered Starbucks was not planning to prosecute them.

In his statement, Ross said he believed the officers ""did absolutely nothing wrong."" He continued:

""[The police officers] followed policy, they did what they were supposed to do, they were professional in all their dealings with these gentlemen and instead, they got the opposite back. I will say that as an African American man, I am very aware of implicit bias. We are committed to fair and unbiased policing and anything less than that will not be tolerated in this department.""

Ross said all commanders in his department receive implicit bias training, and all new recruits are sent to both the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. ""We want them to know about the atrocities that were, in fact, committed by policing around the world,"" he says.

A police spokesman told the Inquirer that the Philadelphia Police Department's internal affairs unit is looking into the incident.

In a statement released Saturday, Philadelphia's mayor Jim Kenney criticized Starbucks for its role in the arrests:

""I am heartbroken to see Philadelphia in the headlines for an incident that ‚Äî at least based on what we know at this point ‚Äî appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018. For many, Starbucks is not just a place to buy a cup of coffee, but a place to meet up with friends or family members, or to get some work done. Like all retail establishments in our city, Starbucks should be a place where everyone is treated the same, no matter the color of their skin.""

The mayor's statement says Starbucks' apology, which the company issued on its Twitter account earlier Saturday, was not enough. Kenney also says he has asked the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations to look into whether additional implicit bias training should be required of Starbucks employees, and his office has reached out to Starbucks directly to discuss the matter.

We apologize to the two individuals and our customers for what took place at our Philadelphia store on Thursday. pic.twitter.com/suUsytXHks ‚Äî Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) April 14, 2018

Mayor Kenney's statement referenced ongoing discussions about criminal justice, policing and incarceration in Philadelphia:

""Commissioner Ross and his team have promised a review of their policies moving forward with regards to response to complaints like this. I believe a thorough review is fully warranted given the unfortunate outcome of this event, particularly at a time when our criminal justice reform efforts are focused on avoiding needless incarcerations.""

The reforms Kenney alludes to have a lot to do with the city's new progressive District Attorney Lawrence Krasner. WHYY's Bobby Allyn recently reported on the change Krasner is pushing for in Philadelphia:

Krasner is a former civil rights lawyer who rode into office on a platform of radically revamping the city's district attorney's office by opposing the death penalty, stepping away from cash bail and seeking shorter prison sentences for offenders.

On Sunday, one day after Kenney criticized Starbucks' Twitter apology, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson released a statement of his own, saying that he will be soon joining other executives already in Philadelphia to speak with those involved in the incident. ""I hope to meet personally with the two men who were arrested to offer a face-to-face apology,"" his statement reads.

The executive added that the company has begun an investigation into its practices, and will ""further train"" its staff to ""better know when police assistance is warranted."""

A viral video of two black men being arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks has elicited three very different responses from police, the company and community members.

In the video, which was posted to Twitter Thursday by Philadelphia resident Melissa DePino, two black men can be seen being escorted out of the coffee shop in handcuffs. Customers can be seen and heard telling officers that the men did nothing wrong.

Included with her tweet, DePino wrote: ‚ÄúThe police were called because these men hadn‚Äôt ordered anything. They were waiting for a friend to show up, who did as they were taken out in handcuffs for doing nothing.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs how stakeholders have so far responded:

Police commissioner says officers did ‚Äònothing wrong‚Äô

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross defended the actions of officers in the video saying his officers ‚Äúdid absolutely nothing wrong.‚Äù

In a statement on Facebook Live, Ross said that Starbucks employees called 911 to report a trespassing complaint.

The employees told officers the two men wanted to use the restroom but were told the facilities are only for paying customers. The Starbucks employees then asked the men to leave, but they refused, Ross said.

Officers responded and asked the men three times ‚Äúpolitely to leave the location because they were being asked to leave by employees because they were trespassing.‚Äù When the men again refused to leave, they were arrested ‚Äúwithout incident,‚Äù Ross said.

The men were taken to a police station and released when it became clear Starbucks didn‚Äôt want to press charges.

‚ÄúThey did a service that they were called to do,‚Äù Ross said of the officers. ‚ÄúAnd if you think about it logically, that if a business calls and they say that someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business, (officers) now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties. And they did just that.‚Äù

Ross, who is black, referenced his own experiences while making his case, saying, ‚ÄúAs an African-American male, I am very aware of implicit bias.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are committed to fair and unbiased policing and anything less than that will not be tolerated in this department.‚Äù

Starbucks CEO apologizes for ‚Äòreprehensible‚Äô incident

Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson called the incident ‚Äúreprehensible‚Äù and outlined steps the company would take to ‚Äúhelp prevent such an occurrence from ever happening again.‚Äù

‚ÄúStarbucks stands firmly against discrimination or racial profiling,‚Äù Johnson said in a statement Saturday. ‚ÄúI hope to meet personally with the two men who were arrested to offer a face-to-face apology.‚Äù

Johnson said Starbucks‚Äô ‚Äúpractices and training led to the bad outcome‚Äù with the two men being arrested.

‚ÄúThe basis for the call to the Philadelphia police department was wrong,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did.‚Äù

Earlier, the company tweeted an apology, saying ‚ÄúWe take these matters seriously and clearly have more work to do when it comes to how we handle incidents in our stores.‚Äù

We apologize to the two individuals and our customers for what took place at our Philadelphia store on Thursday. pic.twitter.com/suUsytXHks ‚Äî Starbucks (@Starbucks) April 14, 2018

A company-wide meeting will be held this week, Johnson said, to share what was learned from the incident, discuss next steps and ‚Äúunderscore our long-standing commitment to treating one another with respect and dignity.‚Äù

Philly activists and community call for justice

Members of Black Lives Matter PA held a demonstration at the Philadelphia Starbucks store on Sunday. The rally started outside Starbucks; protesters then went inside to confront the manager.

Asa Khalif of Black Lives Matter called it the ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Protest,‚Äù according to CNN affiliate WPVI-TV.

‚ÄúBlack and brown people deserve to have a safe space without being profiled. Shoutout to the white allies who stood up and saw injustice and fought against it challenging the police. That‚Äôs what this is about,‚Äù Khalif said.

Message to the @Starbucks in Philadelphia....Our city is shining bright like a diamond right now. Please make this situation right. I repeat please make this situation right!!!!!!! Once again MAKE THIS RIGHT ‚Äî Kevin Hart (@KevinHart4real) April 15, 2018

Celebrities and politicians are also calling for action. Comedian Kevin Hart, a Philadelphia native, tweeted Sunday that Starbucks needed to ‚Äúmake this situation right.‚Äù

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said Starbucks‚Äô apology ‚Äúis not enough.‚Äù

He said he ‚Äúasked the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations to examine the firm‚Äôs polices and procedures, including the extent of, or need for, implicit bias training for its employees.‚Äù

Kenney said he‚Äôs ‚Äúheartbroken to see Philadelphia in the headlines for an incident like that,‚Äù which he says ‚Äúappears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018.‚Äù

‚ÄúStarbucks should be a place where everyone is treated the same, no matter the color of their skin,‚Äù Kenney says."

The arrest of two black men inside the Starbucks at 18th and Spruce streets in Rittenhouse on Thursday has come under intense scrutiny, with many claiming it shows blatant discrimination in action. The Philadelphia Police, the Philly Mayor‚Äôs Office and Starbucks are all launching investigations into what happened.

In a video posted to Twitter on April 12, Philly Police officers can be seen calmly confronting the men, cuffing their wrists with zip ties, then leading them away.

Other people in the cafe at the time can be heard protesting that the men ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt do anything‚Äù and ‚Äúwere just sitting there‚Äù before they were arrested.

Per comments in the thread, the men‚Äôs offense was not ordering anything as they sat and waited for another friend to arrive. ‚ÄúAll the other white ppl are wondering why it‚Äôs never happened to us when we do the same thing,‚Äù wrote Melissa DePino, the woman who posted the video.

https://twitter.com/missydepino/status/984539713016094721

The men were released from custody after the Philadelphia District Attorney‚Äôs Office declined to have them arraigned. Starbucks initially said on Twitter that it was looking into the incident, and then on Saturday afternoon tweeted an apology to the men.

Philly Police tweeted Saturday morning that the department was looking into the matter, and followed up Saturday afternoon with a statement from Commissioner Richard Ross via Facebook Live.

The PPD officers in the video ‚Äúdid absolutely nothing wrong,‚Äù Ross said, explaining that because they were responding to a trespassing call from a business, the officers had an ‚Äúobligation‚Äù to remove the men from the premises.

Mayor Jim Kenney issued a statement Saturday afternoon that expressed dismay over what had happened.

‚ÄúI am heartbroken to see Philadelphia in the headlines,‚Äù the statement began, ‚Äúfor an incident that ‚Äî at least based on what we know at this point ‚Äî appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018.‚Äù

Late Saturday night, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson issued a formal letter of apology. In it, he pledged the company would ‚Äúmake the necessary changes‚Äù to help ensure something like this never happens again. Johnson will be traveling to Philly to speak with customers and local leaders. He also hopes to potentially meet with the men who were arrested, the letter said.

What we know

DePino, a local author, did not shoot the video, she told Billy Penn, but posted it after a friend recorded it.

A more extended video of the same incident from a different angle was posted on YouTube.

The incident occurred around 4:30 p.m., DePino told Billy Penn. At the time she tweeted her video (5:12 p.m.), she said, the men were being put into a patrol car.

According to DePino‚Äôs original tweet, the men hadn‚Äôt yet ordered anything because they were waiting for a friend, who arrived just as they were being led away.

Per Commissioner Ross, the men entered, sat down, then tried to use the bathroom. Starbucks employees mentioned the company policy that bathroom use required a purchase, and asked the men to leave. When the men refused, Ross said, that‚Äôs when the cops were called.

On arrival, the officers asked the men to leave ‚Äî per Ross, three times. The men continued to refuse, and so were arrested.

Per a PMN report, the white man seen questioning the cops in the viral video is Andrew Yaffe, a real estate developer who said the two arrested men were there to meet him.

Per DePino, who told Billy Penn she is in contact with the affected parties, the men were reportedly released from PPD District 9 custody around 1:30 a.m. Friday morning. This would mean the men were held for approximately eight hours.

The Philadelphia District Attorney‚Äôs office declined to have the men arraigned because of lack of evidence, a spokesperson for DA Larry Krasner confirmed to Billy Penn.

Commissioner Ross said the men were released because after the paperwork was processed, PPD ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù Starbucks no longer wanted to press charges.

The charge being considered was ‚Äúdefiant trespass,‚Äù per criminal defense attorney Lauren A. Wimmer, who was involved in getting the men released. Wimmer tweeted Saturday morning that what had happened to them was not only ‚Äúreprehensible,‚Äù but was also ‚Äúillegal.‚Äù



The video speaks for itself. What took place at the 18th and Spruce #Philly @Starbucks was reprehensible. Two young black men, who were simply waiting to be joined by a friend, were blatantly discriminated against based on their race. Not only is this inexcusable, it's illegal. ‚Äî Lauren A. Wimmer (@LAWimmerESQ) April 14, 2018

She corroborated the idea that the two men were simply waiting for a friend, and suggested that they ‚Äúwere blatantly discriminated against based on their race.‚Äù

Starbucks initially said it was investigating the incident, and then issued two apologies. The first was via a tweet posted Saturday just before 1 p.m., which said the company was ‚Äúdisappointed this led to an arrest,‚Äù and that it was reviewing its policies ‚Äúto try to ensure these types of situations never happen in any of our stores.‚Äù

In the Starbucks CEO letter sent Saturday night, Johnson says, ‚ÄúOur store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did.‚Äù

Mayor Kenney, in his Saturday statement, called for the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations to examine Starbucks policies and procedures surrounding implicit bias training.

Commissioner Ross underscored that the Philly Police go through regular implicit bias training. He also noted that as an African American male, he is all too aware that implicit bias exists.

On Saturday, there were protesters standing outside the cafe, per photos posted to Twitter.

PHILADELPHIA ‚Äî Philadelphia's police commissioner on Saturday defended officers who arrested two black men at a Starbucks, prompting accusations of racism on social media, concern from the mayor and an apology from the company.

Videos posted online show officers handcuffing the men in the downtown establishment on Thursday. A white man in the video is heard saying he was meeting with the men and calls the arrest ""ridiculous.""

Commissioner Richard Ross said Starbucks employees called 911 to say the men were trespassing. He said officers were told that the men had come in and asked to use the restroom but were denied because they hadn't bought anything, as he said is company policy. He said they then refused to leave.

Ross, who is black, said police asked the men to leave three times but they refused, and they were then arrested but were later released after the company elected not to prosecute. He said the officers ""did absolutely nothing wrong"" and were professional in their conduct toward the individuals but ""got the opposite back."" He did not mention the person who said he was meeting with the men.

""As an African-American male, I am very aware of implicit bias; we are committed to fair and unbiased policing,"" Ross said. But he added, ""If a business calls and they say that, 'Someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business,' (officers) now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties and they did just that.""

What was Starbucks' response?

Starbucks posted an apology on Twitter Saturday, saying the company was ""disappointed this led to an arrest"" and was reviewing its policies.

""We take these matters seriously and clearly have more work to do when it comes to how we handle incidents in our store,"" the company said in a statement Saturday afternoon.

Ross said he doesn't patronize Starbucks but recalled an incident from a few years ago in which a uniformed sergeant was denied access to a Starbucks bathroom ""so they are at least consistent in their policy.""

Mayor heartbroken seeing Philadelphia in headlines

Mayor Jim Kenney said he asked the city Commission on Human Relations to examine the company's policies and procedures ""including the extent of, or need for, implicit bias training for its employees.""

""I am heartbroken to see Philadelphia in the headlines for an incident that ‚Äî at least based on what we know at this point ‚Äî appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018,"" Kenney said in a statement.

Kenney said a review promised by police of policies in similar situations ""is fully warranted given the unfortunate outcome of this event, particularly at a time when our criminal justice reform efforts are focused on avoiding needless incarcerations.""

Attorney Lauren Wimmer told The Philadelphia Inquirer that the men, who she did not identify, were commercial real estate professionals and were meeting with the another man to discuss business. She identified herself as a friend of the man they were meeting with.

A spokesman for the district attorney's office said the two black men were released ""because of lack of evidence"" that a crime had been committed, but declined further comment, citing a police investigation.

Following a video that went viral on April 12 showing two black men being arrested in a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Starbucks, the manager at that store is no longer working there, according to what the company told ABC News. That came after Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson appeared on Good Morning America Monday, April 16, to apologize to the two men arrested amidst ""reprehensible"" circumstances at one of the coffee chain's Philadelphia locations. He also said that manager will undergo ""unconscious bias"" training in the future.

A spokesperson for the Philadelphia District Attorney told The Washington Post the two men who had been arrested would not be charged with any crimes due to a lack of evidence.

As of Monday, protestors continued to organize in Philly, as documented by a reporter on the ground. NBC Philadelphia Digital Reporter Alicia Lozano tweeted a photo of a sign at the store saying the location was closed and later shared a video of Johnson addressing a meeting he had with Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kinney. A sit-in at another Philly-area Starbucks also began on Monday.

Updated April 15, 2018 at 2:50 PM:

On Thursday, April 12, a video of two men being arrested at a Starbucks location in Philadelphia went viral, with many people online accusing the store of racism and racial profiling. (The company has since apologized for the incident and said in a statement that they plan to investigate the facts.) Now, Melissa DePino, the woman who initially posted the video on social media, is speaking out to explain why she decided to film and share the events.

In conversation with Philadelphia magazine, DePino explained that she noticed the two men when the police showed up in the store. ""The girl behind the counter had called 911, apparently, and the cops came and said the guys were 'trespassing,'"" she said. ""They said we were waiting for somebody, and then the white guy in the video ‚Äî that‚Äôs their family friend they were waiting for ‚Äî he shows up. The guys wanted to know what they did. And then more cops and more cops and more cops show up.""

DePino added that the situation escalated from there when other customers in the shop began asking what was going on. She noted that the two men who were arrested ""never raised their voices"" and they ""never did anything remotely aggressive.""

Incidentally, DePino didn't think that her video would go viral. ""People ignore this kind of stuff,"" she explained to the publication. ""They don‚Äôt believe that it happens. People are saying that there must be more to this story. There is not. This would never happen to someone who looks like me. People don‚Äôt believe black people when they say this stuff happens. It does. They want to know the extenuating circumstances. There are none."""

Two Black real estate agents were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks for waiting for a friend who showed up as they were being handcuffed.

The two arrested men were taken to a police station, fingerprinted and photographed, then released eight hours later because the district attorney found no evidence they had committed a crime and Starbucks expressed no intention to press charges.

In a statement issued via Facebook Live, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross defended the actions of officers in the video, saying that they ""did absolutely nothing wrong"":

Ross said that Starbucks employees called 911 to report a trespassing complaint. The employees told officers the two men wanted to use the restroom but were told the facilities are only for paying customers. The Starbucks employees then asked the men to leave, but they refused, Ross said. Officers responded and asked the men three times ""politely to leave the location because they were being asked to leave by employees because they were trespassing."" When the men again refused to leave, they were arrested ""without incident,"" Ross said. ""They did a service that they were called to do,"" Ross said of the officers. ""And if you think about it logically, that if a business calls and they say that someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business, (officers) now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties. And they did just that."" Ross, who is black, referenced his own experiences while making his case, saying, ""As an African-American male, I am very aware of implicit bias."" ""We are committed to fair and unbiased policing and anything less than that will not be tolerated in this department.""

Starbucks extended an apology to the ""two individuals and our customers for what took place,"" promising to review their policies so that ""these types of situations never happen"" again:"
https://www.phillyvoice.com/starbucks-arrest-philadelphia-center-city-police-investigating/,Protests over controversial arrests at Center City Starbucks; Police commissioner says officers did nothing wrong,14/04/2018,https://www.phillyvoice.com,"UPDATE: Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross addressed the April 12 incident at Starbucks in a Facebook Live post on Saturday afternoon.

Authorities arrested two black men at Starbucks (18th and Spruce Streets) because they would not leave the store at the company's request, Commissioner Ross said.

One of the men asked to use the bathroom but was denied, per the company's policy, because he and his friend were not paying customers, according to Ross. The two men were deemed to be trespassing because they allegedly wouldn't make a purchase and wouldn't leave.

A Starbucks employee called 911 after the men, both realtors who were waiting for a friend to arrive, refused to leave the store, the commissioner said.

Their friend arrived just as the men were being placed in handcuffs. He pleaded with officers for an explanation but was told not to interfere.

""These officers did absolutely nothing wrong,"" Ross said Saturday. ""They did a service that they were called to do. They have a legal obligation to carry out their duties.""

Amid a growing public uproar, Ross adamantly defended the officers' actions. They were compelled to execute the request of a private business to have the two men removed, Ross said.

The men were placed under arrest because they refused to leave the store when police asked them to do so, Ross said, including a police supervisor who was called to the scene after the initial dispute.

Ross added that as an African-American he is aware of implicit bias but did not find that to be present in this case. The Philadelphia Police Department holds routine training to prevent such bias from influencing the decisions of its officers, he said.

""Anything less than that will not be tolerated,"" Ross said. ""We will examine this case further to see if we can do things better in the future.""

The commissioner also noted a separate incident at another Center City Starbucks in September 2015. In that case, a uniformed police officer was denied access to the store's bathroom because he was not a paying customer. Starbucks eventually apologized to the police officer.

In Thursday's case, Ross said, the two men were not charged because Starbucks employees later decided they did not want to prosecute.

Starbucks, facing outrage from across the country, issued an apology on Saturday afternoon.

By late Saturday afternoon, protesters had gathered outside the Starbucks where the incident occurred.

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney also released a statement on Thursday's incident.

I am heartbroken to see Philadelphia in the headlines for an incident that -- at least based on what we know at this point -- appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018. For many, Starbucks is not just a place to buy a cup of coffee, but a place to meet up with friends or family members, or to get some work done. Like all retail establishments in our city, Starbucks should be a place where everyone is treated the same, no matter the color of their skin. Starbucks has issued an apology, but that is not enough. I have asked the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations to examine the firm‚Äôs policies and procedures, including the extent of, or need for, implicit bias training for its employees. We are reaching out to Starbucks to begin a discussion about this. Commissioner Ross and his team have promised a review of their policies moving forward with regards to response to complaints like this. I believe a thorough review is fully warranted given the unfortunate outcome of this event, particularly at a time when our criminal justice reform efforts are focused on avoiding needless incarcerations.

Ross concluded his remarks with an assurance that more information will be forthcoming in the near future.

ORIGINAL STORY:

Philadelphia police have launched an internal investigation into two controversial arrests Thursday afternoon at a Starbucks in Center City.



The incident, captured on video and posted on Twitter, occurred at the Starbucks on 18th and Spruce Streets. Two black men, who were not identified, are placed in handcuffs and led out of the coffee shop as confused witnesses press police for an explanation. A longer video of the incident ‚Äî about eight minutes in length ‚Äî was later uploaded to YouTube. The two men who were arrested appear calm throughout the encounter with police before they are placed in handcuffs. One of the officers can be heard saying the men were asked to leave the caf√© for reasons that remain unclear. The woman who posted the first video on Twitter later confirmed that both men have since been released without charges. In a tweet late Friday night, Philadelphia police said the incident is under internal investigation. Starbucks also issued a statement on the incident. The video of Thursday's incident, viewed more than 4 million times, generated an intense debate on Twitter about the tendency to make biased assumptions in cases involve racial profiling, as well as whether police or Starbucks should carry more of the responsibility for what happened.

In a statement to Starbucks customers and employees Saturday, CEO Kevin Johnson acknowledged ‚Äúa disheartening situation in one of our Philadelphia-area stores this past Thursday, that led to a reprehensible outcome.‚Äù

Cellphone videos captured the tense moment Thursday afternoon when at least six Philadelphia Police Department officers stood over two seated black men, asking them to leave. A man named Andrew Yaffe arrives to tell police that the two men were waiting for him. The officer says that they were not complying and were being arrested for trespassing.

‚ÄúWhy would they be asked to leave?‚Äù Yaffe says. ‚ÄúDoes anybody else think this is ridiculous?‚Äù he asks people nearby. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absolute discrimination,‚Äù Yaffe adds. The two unidentified men are taken out in handcuffs soon after. They were released early Friday with no charges filed.

One of the videos of the arrest rocketed across social media, with 4.5 million views by Saturday evening.

@Starbucks The police were called because these men hadn‚Äôt ordered anything. They were waiting for a friend to show up, who did as they were taken out in handcuffs for doing nothing.

Lauren Wimmer, the attorney for the two men, told The Washington Post that her clients told a Starbucks employee that they were waiting for Yaffe. Shortly after, a white female employee called the police, Wimmer said.

Wimmer said Yaffe, who runs a real estate development firm, said that he was there to meet the men to discuss business investment opportunities.

The two men, whom she declined to identify, were taken to a police station, fingerprinted and photographed. One officer suggested that they faced charges for ‚Äúdefiant trespassing,‚Äù Wimmer said. They were held for nearly nine hours before they were released, she said, after prosecutors said they would not pursue charges.

Benjamin Waxman, a spokesman for Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, said the office decided that there ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt sufficient evidence to charge [the men] with a crime.‚Äù

In his statement, Johnson said the video was hard to watch and that he hopes to meet the two men to offer ‚Äúa face-to-face‚Äù apology, adding that the company‚Äôs practices and training ‚Äúled to a bad outcome ‚Äî the basis for the call to the Philadelphia police department was wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did,‚Äù Johnson said.

Johnson said the company would conduct an investigation and make ‚Äúany necessary changes to our practices that would help prevent such an occurrence from ever happening again.‚Äù

Earlier in the day the company tweeted a statement apologizing to the two men and said it was ‚Äúdisappointed this led to an arrest.‚Äù

After the arrest, the police were also being criticized for their handling of the situation. Police Commissioner Richard Ross addressed the incident on Facebook Live on Saturday, saying that one or both of the men asked to use the restroom but had not purchased anything. An employee said Starbucks company policy was to refuse use of the bathrooms to non-customers and asked the men to leave, according to Ross. The employee called the police when they refused.

‚ÄúThese officers did absolutely nothing wrong. They followed policy; they did what they were supposed to do. They were professional in all their dealings with these gentlemen,‚Äù Ross said. ‚ÄúAnd instead, they got the opposite back.‚Äù Ross said police arrested the men after they refused three requests to leave.

Ross, a black man, said he was aware of issues of implicit bias ‚Äî unconscious discrimination based on race ‚Äî but did not say whether he believed it applied in this case. He said the incident underscores the need for more body-worn cameras to present different perspectives of police responses. The officers were not wearing cameras, he said.

At least two cellphone videos captured the incident.

The police department said Thursday that it was investigating and would comment once more facts were known. It was not immediately clear whether Ross‚Äôs statement means the investigation has concluded.

Starbucks does not have a companywide policy on asking members of the public to leave, said the company official.

The company leaves safety and customer service protocol decisions up to store managers, said a company official familiar with the incident, who declined to give a name to freely describe internal discussions. They may leave restroom doors unlocked or add key code entries if they feel the store is more at risk for criminal behavior. A store in the same area of Philadelphia experienced an armed robbery recently, the official said.

The Starbucks official acknowledged that the incident is at odds with what many people have done at a Starbucks without drawing suspicion or calls to police. The stores are ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù hubs, the official said, where people often drop in to use the WiFi or chat with friends without necessarily ordering anything.

Wimmer said she spent a good portion of her time in law school in Starbucks without buying much and never had a problem as a white woman.

The incident was about race, Wimmer said. She suggested an experiment: Go to a Starbucks and assess the demographics of people sitting there.

‚ÄúWho is the manager going to call and say, ‚ÄòPlease leave?‚Äô ‚Äù she asked."

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney has asked the city‚Äôs Commission on Human Relations to review Starbucks‚Äô policies and procedures following the controversial arrests of two black men at a Center City location.

‚ÄúI am heartbroken to see Philadelphia in the headlines for an incident that ‚Äî at least based on what we know at this point ‚Äî appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018,‚Äù Kenney said in a statement Saturday evening. ‚ÄúFor many, Starbucks is not just a place to buy a cup of coffee, but a place to meet up with friends or family members, or to get some work done. Like all retail establishments in our city, Starbucks should be a place where everyone is treated the same, no matter the color of their skin.‚Äù

The incident, which was captured on a Twitter video, has sparked outrage against Starbucks and the Philadelphia Police Department on social media, with many Twitter users alleging that the arrests were racially motivated.

In the video posted by @MelissaDePino at 5:12 p.m. Thursday, police can be seen arresting two black men at a Starbucks located at 18th and Spruce streets near Rittenhouse Square.

Another man in the video, who is white, can be seen and heard speaking to one of the officers, saying, ‚ÄúThis is ridiculous. What did they get called for, because there are two black guys sitting here meeting me?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt do anything, I saw the entire thing,‚Äù another person out of view responds.

Then, the two men can be seen calmly walking out of the Starbucks, escorted by police, arms handcuffed behind their backs.

‚ÄúThe police were called because these men hadn‚Äôt ordered anything,‚Äù @MelissaDePino said in the Twitter post that contained the video. ‚ÄúThey were waiting for a friend to show up, who did as they were taken out in handcuffs for doing nothing.‚Äù

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross said in a video posted to the department‚Äôs Facebook page Saturday afternoon that the police officers involved ‚Äúdid absolutely nothing wrong.‚Äù

Starbucks has issued an apology to the men, saying the company is ‚Äúdisappointed this led to an arrest,‚Äù and is reviewing the incident and its policies.

Ross said around 4:40 p.m. on Thursday, two Starbucks employees called 911 ‚Äúfor a disturbance and trespassing.‚Äù The employees called police when the two men refused to leave after they were told they could not use the bathroom without making a purchase, per Starbucks company policy, Ross said.

When the officers arrived, Ross said they ‚Äúpolitely‚Äù asked the men to leave three times, but they still refused. The officers placed the men under arrest and took them to the nearby police district, he said.

‚ÄúThe officers, after processing paperwork, discovered that Starbucks no longer was interested in prosecuting,‚Äù Ross said. ‚ÄúAnd so at that point, those males were released from custody.‚Äù

The department has not released the names of the two men.

The Philadelphia District Attorney‚Äôs Office said earlier Saturday it had declined to bring charges against both men due to a lack of evidence.

‚ÄúIt is important for me to say that, in short, these officers did absolutely nothing wrong,‚Äù Ross said. ‚ÄúThey followed policy. They did what they were supposed to do. They were professional in all of their dealings with these gentleman and instead they got the opposite back.

‚ÄúAs an African-American male, I am very aware of implicit bias,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe are committed to fair and unbiased policing and anything less than that will not be tolerated in this department.‚Äù

Ross said the department will continue to examine the incident, which he said was evidence of the need to equip more officers with body-worn cameras. Currently about 700 Philadelphia police officers have body-worn cameras, not including those involved in the incident at Starbucks, Ross said."

Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson responded to public outcry over the arrest of two black men on Saturday from a Philadelphia branch of the coffee shop, calling the incident ‚Äúreprehensible.‚Äù

The arrest, which was captured on video that has since gone viral, sparked accusations of discrimination and racial profiling.

In his statement, Johnson outlined steps the company would take to ensure a greater ‚Äúsense of community.‚Äù

Below is Johnson‚Äôs full statement:

Dear Starbucks Partners and Customers:

By now, you may be aware of a disheartening situation in one of our Philadelphia-area stores this past Thursday, that led to a reprehensible outcome.

I‚Äôm writing this evening to convey three things:

First, to once again express our deepest apologies to the two men who were arrested with a goal of doing whatever we can to make things right. Second, to let you know of our plans to investigate the pertinent facts and make any necessary changes to our practices that would help prevent such an occurrence from ever happening again. And third, to reassure you that Starbucks stands firmly against discrimination or racial profiling.

In the coming days, I will be joining our regional vice president, Camille Hymes ‚Äî who is on the ground in Philadelphia ‚Äî to speak with partners, customers and community leaders as well as law enforcement. Most importantly, I hope to meet personally with the two men who were arrested to offer a face-to-face apology.

We have immediately begun a thorough investigation of our practices. In addition to our own review, we will work with outside experts and community leaders to understand and adopt best practices. The video shot by customers is very hard to watch and the actions in it are not representative of our Starbucks Mission and Values. Creating an environment that is both safe and welcoming for everyone is paramount for every store. Regretfully, our practices and training led to a bad outcome ‚Äî the basis for the call to the Philadelphia Police Department was wrong. Our store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did.

We also will further train our partners to better know when police assistance is warranted. Additionally, we will host a company-wide meeting next week to share our learnings, discuss some immediate next steps and underscore our long-standing commitment to treating one another with respect and dignity. I know our store managers and partners work hard to exceed our customers‚Äô expectations every day ‚Äî which makes this very poor reflection on our company all the more painful.

Finally, to our partners who proudly wear the green apron and to customers who come to us for a sense of community every day: You can and should expect more from us. We will learn from this and be better.

Respectfully,

Kevin Johnson

Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson issued a lengthy apology statement Saturday night as online backlash against the coffee giant grew over the arrests of two black men in a Philadelphia store.

Several videos that went viral showed police officers handcuffing two men and leading them out of the store, over the protestations of bystanders who said ""they didn't do anything.""

Philadelphia authorities said the men had been sitting in the cafe and asked baristas if they could use the restroom, though they hadn't bought anything. Police said that when the Starbucks employees declined and asked them to leave, the men refused and one barista called the police.

In one video, a white man, who media outlets identified as Andrew Yaffe, says he was there to meet the two men. He argued with one of the police officers, calling the arrests ""ridiculous.""

""What did they do?"" Yaffe asks repeatedly. When one officer tells him that the police department received a call from the store, he replies, ""What did they get called for? That there are two black guys sitting here meeting me?""

At that point, a bystander pipes up: ""They didn't do anything. I saw the entire thing.""

'Our practices and training led to a bad outcome'

Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson presents during the Starbucks 2016 Investor Day meeting, in New York, Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016. Associated Press/Richard Drew

Johnson said he was issuing the statement to ""once again express our deepest apologies,"" as well as address the company's plans to investigate the incident and change any practices necessary, and assure the public that ""Starbucks stands firmly against discrimination or racial profiling.""

""Regretfully, our practices and training led to a bad outcome ‚Äî the basis for the call to the Philadelphia police department was wrong,"" Johnson said. ""Our store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did.""

Johnson said he will join the company's regional vice president, Camille Hymes, in Philadelphia to speak with employees, customers, community leaders, and law-enforcement officials. He added that he wants to personally meet with the two men who were arrested ""to offer a face-to-face apology.""

He added that Starbucks is launching an investigation of its practices and intends to work with ""community leaders"" and outside experts to adopt changes. He said employees will also receive training to better know when police should be called.

Starbucks had issued a briefer apology earlier on Saturday, which was instantly criticized as being insufficient and unclear on what steps the company would take to address and rectify the situation.

""We apologize to the two individuals and our customers and are disappointed this led to an arrest,"" the initial statement read. ""We take these matters seriously and clearly have more work to do when it comes to how we handle incidents in our stores.""

The Philadelphia Police Department has defended the officers who arrested the men, and said they ""did absolutely nothing wrong,"" and had legal standing to arrest the men for trespassing.

The District Attorney declined to prosecute the men, saying there was a ""lack of evidence of a crime."""

Protesters gathered Sunday outside of a Starbucks in Philadelphia, where police arrested two black men Thursday, drawing accusations of racial profiling.

The demonstration began around noon outside the City Center Starbucks, with protesters carrying megaphones and signs that read ""Too Little Too Latte,"" and ""#Enough/Shame On Your Starbucks."" Some social media users have begun using the hashtag #BoycottStarbucks in posts about the arrest.

On Saturday, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson released a statement offering ""our deepest apologies"" to the two men who were handcuffed and taken out of the caf√© by police last week. Johnson also declared a company ""goal of doing whatever we can to make things right,"" and said he hoped ""to meet personally with the two men who were arrested to offer a face-to-face apology.""

Police say Starbucks employees called 911 alleging disturbance and trespassing by two customers. When police arrived, two Starbucks employees told them two men had asked to use the restroom but were told they couldn't because they hadn't purchased anything. The men allegedly refused to leave after being asked by Starbucks employees. Police also say the two men refused to leave after being asked three times by officers, and were then arrested.

Starbucks customers recorded the arrest on their cell phones, and in a video posted on social media, a man named Andrew Yaffe, who is white, says he's there to meet with the two being placed in handcuffs by police. ""What did they get called for? Because there are two black guys sitting here meeting me? ... What did they do?""

""They didn't do anything,"" a woman responds in the video, ""I saw the entire thing.""

Police arrested the men, and took them to a police station where they were fingerprinted and photographed. The men were released nearly eight hours later, and charges were never filed. Their attorney, Lauren Wimmer, told The Washington Post the district attorney found no evidence of a crime, and added that the manager of the Starbucks where the arrests occurred was white.

Melissa DePino, who recorded the video that went viral on social media, amassing more than 9 million views, described the arrest to Philadelphia magazine, ""These guys never raised their voices. They never did anything remotely aggressive ... I was sitting close to where they were. Very close. They were not doing anything. They weren't.""

Starbucks it ""stands firmly against"" racial profiling and is investigating the incident.

""The police should not have been called in this situation,"" Starbucks Chief Operating Officer Rosalind Brewer told NPR's Rachel Martin on Monday, adding that as an African-American herself, she found it painful to watch the video.

""This is a teachable moment for all of us,"" she said. ""And we take full responsibility to make sure that our company remains great. Good companies acknowledge their mistakes and learn from them and then make the necessary changes.""

Philadelphia Police say they are also conducting an internal investigation.

In statement, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney criticized Starbucks for its role in the arrests, and says he is ""heartbroken to see Philadelphia in the headlines for an incident that ‚Äî at least based on what we know at this point ‚Äî appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018.""

He's asked the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations to determine if Starbucks needs training for implicit bias, or unconscious discrimination that can impact the judgments and actions of its employees.

""Starbucks should be a place where everyone is treated the same, no matter the color of their skin,"" Kenney said.

The company says it plans to hold a company-wide meeting this week to discuss next steps.

""Regretfully, our practices and training led to a bad outcome ‚Äî the basis for the call to the Philadelphia Police Department was wrong,"" Johnson said, ""Our store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did.""

Starbucks says it will hold a company-wide meeting this week to discuss next steps, and ""underscore our long-standing commitment to treating one another with respect and dignity.""

""This is a time for us to look at policies, to look at our training and development, to look at our store managers and give them the required skills that they need,"" Brewer said, ""and we're doing all of that."""

But this time, the ugly encounter that led to the arrest of two black men involved Starbucks, a chain that has tried to position itself as both home to progressive policies and a place to socialize, not just to sip coffee. It has tried to stand apart from diners like Applebee's and IHOP, where other racially charged incidents have occurred recently.

Calls for a boycott continued Monday as Starbucks' CEO took to television to apologize, saying he is going to institute ""unconscious bias"" training for managers.

The apology came as the furor built over a videotaped incident in which police at a Starbucks in the Center City district of downtown Philadelphia arrested the men Thursday after store employees said they were trespassing. The men, according to police, had asked to use the restroom. But employees, citing store policy that only paying customers can use the restrooms, refused. They sat down and wouldn't leave when asked by employees to do so, police said.

The men explained they were waiting for a friend, who happened to be white and is seen having arrived in the video and questioning why officers would handcuff and arrest them. The video has drawn more than 9.5 million views online, and there was also an active #BoycottStarbucks movement on Twitter.

Another video surfaced Monday, one of an African-American man in the Los Angeles area attempting to show that he was denied use of a locked Starbucks restroom while a white customer was allowed to use it.

Social media has filled with calls to boycott Starbucks, with some showing photos of cups from rival fast-food chains where they had bought a cup of coffee. On Monday, demonstrators gathered at the Starbucks in Philadelphia to protest, chanting slogans like, ‚ÄúA whole lot of racism, a whole lot of crap, Starbucks coffee is anti-black.‚Äù A Starbucks regional vice president who attempted to talk to the protesters was shouted down.

In addition to his appearance on ABC's Good Morning America, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson was offering to meet with community leaders, but the company declined to make any executives available for interviews. The company ""stands firmly against discrimination or racial profiling,"" he said in the statement. He said the Seattle-based company's policies led to a ""bad outcome.""

Federal law says it is illegal for retailers to discriminate against customers by color, race, land of origin, religion or disability. Retailers can refuse service based on a dress code, but the retailer must be consistent in applying that refusal.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross has defended his officers' actions. When the officers arrived, they asked the men ""politely"" to leave multiple times before the arrests, Ross said. They were released when Starbucks declined to prosecute.

The coffee chain is the latest retailer to face charges of discriminatory conduct.

Last month, Applebee's fired three employees after they were involved in the racial profiling of two African-American women who, while during their dinner at the Independence, Mo., restaurant, were falsely accused of skipping out without paying their bill the day before.

An IHOP in Auburn, Maine, apologized after a server asked a group of black teens to pay upfront for their meal last month. The restaurant manager said he did not think the server‚Äôs action was racially motivated because the restaurant had some problems with teens leaving without paying.

In January, a black man alleged that he had been racially profiled at an Old Navy store in West Des Moines, Iowa, when he was asked to prove he had previously purchased an Old Navy jacket he was wearing.

Celebrities say they've faced similar treatment. Actress Gabourey Sidibe wrote on the Lemmy Letter, an online feminist newsletter, how she had been racially profiled at a Chanel store.

Similarly, President Obama said he had been racially profiled before becoming president.

‚ÄúThere are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store,"" he said after the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin. ‚ÄúThat includes me.""

Starbucks, however, has tried to position itself as more socially progressive. It welcomes customers to come and hang out in comfy chairs with plenty of electrical outlets so that people can charge laptops and mobile devices, with little pressure to purchase anything.

‚ÄúStarbucks has the mantra, ‚ÄòYou come and sit and use the WiFi,‚Äô‚Äù said Janet Lowder, president of Restaurant Management Services in the Los Angeles area. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs different for Starbucks than any other fast-food (chain).‚Äù

On Monday, the vibe turned sour.

""I‚Äôm tired of the continued racial profiling against communities of color, I‚Äôm tired of the weak corporate response when these incident(s) happen, & I‚Äôm tired of leaders standing by while disparate treatment of people of color makes headlines every single week,"" tweeted Kevin Johnson, a candidate for Pennsylvania's 3rd District in the U.S. House of Representatives who happens to have the same name as the Starbucks CEO.

UPDATE, April 17: After Philadelphia Starbucks arrests, chain to close stores May 29 for bias training

UPDATE: Philadelphia Police Department radio transmission from the incident:

***

The arrest of two black men inside the Starbucks at 18th and Spruce streets in Rittenhouse on Thursday has come under intense scrutiny, with many claiming it shows blatant discrimination in action. The Philadelphia Police, the Philly Mayor‚Äôs Office and Starbucks are all launching investigations into what happened.

In a video posted to Twitter on April 12, Philly Police officers can be seen calmly confronting the men, cuffing their wrists with zip ties, then leading them away.

More:Two black men arrested at Philly Starbucks for 'doing nothing,' witness says

Other people in the cafe at the time can be heard protesting that the men ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt do anything‚Äù and ‚Äúwere just sitting there‚Äù before they were arrested.

Per comments in the thread, the men‚Äôs offense was not ordering anything as they sat and waited for another friend to arrive. ‚ÄúAll the other white ppl are wondering why it‚Äôs never happened to us when we do the same thing,‚Äù wrote Melissa DePino, the woman who posted the video.

The men were released from custody after the Philadelphia District Attorney‚Äôs Office declined to have them arraigned. Starbucks initially said on Twitter that it was looking into the incident, and then on Saturday afternoon tweeted an apology to the men.

Philly Police tweeted Saturday morning that the department was looking into the matter, and followed up Saturday afternoon with a statement from Commissioner Richard Ross via Facebook Live.

Story continues below:

The PPD officers in the video ‚Äúdid absolutely nothing wrong,‚Äù Ross said, explaining that because they were responding to a trespassing call from a business, the officers had an ‚Äúobligation‚Äù to remove the men from the premises.

Mayor Jim Kenney issued a statement Saturday afternoon that expressed dismay over what had happened.

‚ÄúI am heartbroken to see Philadelphia in the headlines,‚Äù the statement began, ‚Äúfor an incident that ‚Äî at least based on what we know at this point ‚Äî appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018.‚Äù

Late Saturday night, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson issued a formal letter of apology. In it, he pledged the company would ‚Äúmake the necessary changes‚Äù to help ensure something like this never happens again. Johnson will be traveling to Philly to speak with customers and local leaders. He also hopes to potentially meet with the men who were arrested, the letter said.

On Tuesday, April 17, Starbucks said it planned to close more than 8,000 U.S. stores for several hours in May to conduct racial-bias training for its nearly 175,000 workers.

What we know

DePino, a local author, did not shoot the video, she told Billy Penn, but posted it after a friend recorded it.

A more extended video of the same incident from a different angle was posted on YouTube.

The incident occurred around 4:30 p.m., DePino told Billy Penn. At the time she tweeted her video (5:12 p.m.), she said, the men were being put into a patrol car.

According to DePino‚Äôs original tweet, the men hadn‚Äôt yet ordered anything because they were waiting for a friend, who arrived just as they were being led away.

Per Commissioner Ross, the men entered, sat down, then tried to use the bathroom. Starbucks employees mentioned the company policy that bathroom use required a purchase, and asked the men to leave. When the men refused, Ross said, that‚Äôs when the cops were called.

On arrival, the officers asked the men to leave ‚Äî per Ross, three times. The men continued to refuse, and so were arrested.

Per a PMN report, the white man seen questioning the cops in the viral video is Andrew Yaffe, a real estate developer who said the two arrested men were there to meet him.

Per DePino, who told Billy Penn she is in contact with the affected parties, the men were reportedly released from PPD District 9 custody around 1:30 a.m. Friday morning. This would mean the men were held for approximately eight hours.

The Philadelphia District Attorney‚Äôs office declined to have the men arraigned because of lack of evidence, a spokesperson for DA Larry Krasner confirmed to Billy Penn.

Commissioner Ross said the men were released because after the paperwork was processed, PPD ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù Starbucks no longer wanted to press charges.

The charge being considered was ‚Äúdefiant trespass,‚Äù per criminal defense attorney Lauren A. Wimmer, who was involved in getting the men released. Wimmer tweeted Saturday morning that what had happened to them was not only ‚Äúreprehensible,‚Äù but was also ‚Äúillegal.‚Äù

She corroborated the idea that the two men were simply waiting for a friend, and suggested that they ‚Äúwere blatantly discriminated against based on their race.‚Äù

Starbucks initially said it was investigating the incident, and then issued two apologies. The first was via a tweet posted Saturday just before 1 p.m., which said the company was ‚Äúdisappointed this led to an arrest,‚Äù and that it was reviewing its policies ‚Äúto try to ensure these types of situations never happen in any of our stores.‚Äù

In the Starbucks CEO letter sent Saturday night, Johnson says, ‚ÄúOur store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did.‚Äù

Mayor Kenney, in his Saturday statement, called for the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations to examine Starbucks policies and procedures surrounding implicit bias training.

Commissioner Ross underscored that the Philly Police go through regular implicit bias training. He also noted that as an African American male, he is all too aware that implicit bias exists.

On Saturday, there were protesters standing outside the cafe, per photos posted to Twitter.

Story continues below:

What we don‚Äôt know

The identities of the men who were arrested.

The identities of the arresting officers.

The names or job descriptions of the Starbucks employees who called the police to begin with, although attorney Wimmer told PMN she believes a manager was involved.

Whether body cameras on the police officers would have made a difference in conduct of any parties involved. Commissioner Ross, in his FB Live statement, said this incident ‚Äúunderscores the need to continue our body cam program.‚Äù

Whether Starbucks does mandate implicit bias training.

Exactly how Starbucks‚Äô current policy would have treated this situation. The cafes have traditionally allowed people to linger. In 2009, the company released a statement saying it does not have any time limits for guests: ‚ÄúWe strive to create a welcoming environment for all of our customers. We do not have any time limits for being in our stores, and continue to focus on making the Third Place experience for every Starbucks customer.‚Äù

Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson is in Philadelphia to, as he put it in an online statement, ""offer a face-to-face apology"" to two African American men who were arrested in a Center City Starbucks last week.

In addition to the two men, Johnson is set to meet with Mayor Kenney and Police Commissioner Richard Ross and other community leaders Monday, a spokeswoman for the Seattle-based company said.

Protests in the meantime resumed at the Starbucks store at 18th and Spruce Streets, where the two men were arrested Thursday. Dozens of protesters occupied the store for a brief time Sunday.

On Monday morning, about 40 protesters, including City Councilmember Helen Gym, filled the Starbucks for noisy protest as four police officers watched from the rear of the store.

""Anti-blackness anywhere is anti-blackness everywhere, was one of their chants.

The men had been sitting at a table waiting for an acquaintance but had not purchased anything, violating a company policy, Ross had said Saturday in a video posted on Facebook. When they were asked to leave and refused, a store manager called police. Police took the men into custody in an encounter that was captured on video that went viral over the weekend, sparking national outrage, even among the most faithful Starbucks customers.

Late Saturday night, Johnson said in an online statement that he wanted to meet with the men who were arrested to ""offer a face-to-face apology"" for the ""reprehensible outcome.""

The men were handcuffed and arrested ‚Äì though no charges were filed against them.

Protesters Sunday demanded the firing of the store manager who had called police and every Philadelphia police officer who participated in the arrest. About 75 people and at least two dozen uniformed officers attended the noon protest, organized by Black Lives Matter activist Asa Khalif.

Halfway through the demonstration that began outside, Khalif led protesters into the store as confused customers looked on.

""Today, today this space is now secure, secured by the people,"" Khalif yelled through a bullhorn once inside.

>>READ MORE: Starbucks arrests put Philly police in national spotlight

He then said to the crowd: ""Should we ask the racist manager to come out?""

""Come out, come out wherever you are,"" one protester said.

Starbucks regional vice president Camille Hymes was on location and spoke with Khalif and the crowd. She said the company ""deeply regrets"" the events that occurred but said the blame lies with Starbucks' policies and not with the store's manager.

""I know the question has come up in terms of whether or not the manager should be fired, and we take full responsibility,"" Hymes said. ""We put her in a position that did not allow her to be set up for success ‚Äì or those two men.""

Protesters remained inside the store for about 10 minutes before peacefully leaving and continuing their rally outside. Among the demonstrators was Dell Merriwether, 60, of Center City, who held up an anti-Starbucks sign while drinking a cup of Wawa coffee.

""I feel it was an overreaction of the police. They could have bought the guys a cup of coffee [instead of arresting them] and we wouldn't be here,"" Merriwether said. ""There's injustice throughout the country, but to see it at home is hard.""

Melissa DePino, who posted the video of the men's arrest, which has been viewed more than nine million times, also attended Sunday's protest.

""It's great, but I want it to be more,"" she said of the video, which was shot by another customer. ""I hope it's more. I want it to keep going.""

Monday's protest is scheduled for 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., according to a Facebook event page titled ""Shut Down Starbucks"" hosted by Philly REAL Justice and the Black & Brown Workers Cooperative. At least 180 people have already indicated they will attend and more than 1,000 have shown interest.

Lauren Wimmer, an attorney for the men who were arrested, did not respond to a request for comment Sunday. The men have not been publicly identified and Wimmer previously declined to provide their names.

Khalif said he doesn't accept Johnson's apology and called Starbucks' response ""lukewarm"" and ""just about saving face."" Khalif brought sage to the protest, which he and other activists used to smudge the outside of the Starbucks ""to reclaim this space because it is tainted with racism.""

Separate investigations into the episode are underway by the mayor's office and the Philadelphia Police Department. Starbucks has launched its own investigation into its practices that led to this ""bad outcome,"" Johnson said in his statement.

""We have immediately begun a thorough investigation of our practices,"" he wrote. ""In addition to our own review, we will work with outside experts and community leaders to understand and adopt best practices.""

In a video posted to Facebook on Saturday, Ross, the police commissioner, said officers responded to a 911 call regarding a disturbance at the store about 4:40 p.m. Thursday, and were told the men had violated Starbucks policy by occupying a table without making a purchase.

In his statement, Johnson said of his company's policy: ""Regretfully, our practices and training led to a bad outcome ‚Äì the basis for the call to the Philadelphia police department was wrong. Our store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did.""

>>READ MORE: Black men's arrest at Philadelphia Starbucks prompts probes amid national outcry

Video of the episode shows at least six police officers responding to the Starbucks. They are seen putting the men in handcuffs and taking them into custody without resistance. Ross said that officers had asked the men to leave three times but that they refused and were subsequently detained.

""These officers did absolutely nothing wrong,"" Ross said.

A white man in the video who has been identified as Andrew Yaffe, a Philadelphia real estate investor, can be seen questioning an officer in the coffee shop about the arrest and says the men were waiting to meet him.

""What did they get called for, because there were two black guys sitting here, meeting me?"" Yaffe asks in the video. ""What did they do?""

The men were held in custody until 12:30 a.m. Friday, Wimmer said Saturday. Ross said they were released when authorities learned Starbucks was ""no longer interested in prosecuting.""

Starbucks' Johnson called the video ""very hard to watch"" and said ""the actions in it are not representative of our Starbucks Mission and Values.""

He said he will be joining Hymes, the regional vice president, ""on the ground in Philadelphia"" to speak with partners, customers, community leaders and police.

""Most importantly, I hope to meet personally with the two men who were arrested to offer a face-to-face apology,"" Johnson wrote in his statement."

‚Äî

Activists are calling on Starbucks to fire the manager of a Philadelphia location where two black men were recently arrested.

More than three-dozen people rallied Sunday afternoon outside the store at 18th and Spruce streets, where police said two Starbucks employees called 911 after the two men refused to leave. Police said the men were asked to leave the store after they were told they could not use the bathroom without making a purchase, per Starbucks‚Äô company policy. Bystanders and the two men‚Äôs attorney said they were simply waiting for a third person, who showed up during the arrest.

On Sunday, Black Lives Matter activist Asa Khalif led the protesters inside the store where he chanted on a bullhorn, ‚ÄúWe are the people, the mighty, mighty people.‚Äù

Khalif also demanded that Starbucks fire the manager, and called on Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross to fire the six officers who responded to the scene.

Starbucks regional vice president Camille Hymes spoke with Khalif and the protesters, thanking them for being peaceful.

On the subject of whether the store manager should be fired, Hymes said, ‚ÄúWe take full responsibility and put her in a position that did not allow her to be set up for success or those two men.‚Äù

‚ÄúBefore you can have any healing, there has to be consequences for her actions,‚Äù Khalif responded. ‚ÄúWhen you call law enforcement on black and brown bodies, they are met with aggression and violence and you know that.‚Äù Watch a video of the protesters‚Äô interaction with Hymes below.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all been in Starbucks. We all know how flexible that policy is,‚Äù said protester Andrew Moulder, of Germantown. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all come in here and used the bathroom. We‚Äôve all come in here and sat down, charged our phone, used a computer, sent messages or whatever, before we ever ordered a cup of coffee.‚Äù

Moulder, who is black, said he doesn‚Äôt blame the company for what happened ‚Äî he blames the store manager for the decision to call the police.

‚ÄúI was just in Starbucks the day before that a quarter of a mile from here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo that could have easily been me having a coffee with my fiancee and then all of a sudden I‚Äôm going to jail, I‚Äôm in jail until 1 a.m. I mean, people lose jobs over that shit all the time in African-American society.‚Äù

‚ÄúI used to come here twice a week, and I‚Äôm not anymore,‚Äù said protester Mike Heisey, who lives around the corner from the Starbucks. Heisey was dressed in a Donald Trump mask and an orange jumpsuit, holding a coffee-cup shaped sign that read, ‚Äúgrande racist, no tax returns.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even going to another Starbucks. I‚Äôm done,‚Äù said Heisey, who is white. ‚ÄúHow do we ever get to a place of equality with this going on? You can‚Äôt allow it.‚Äù

Another protest at the Starbucks is planned for Monday morning at 7 a.m.

Starbucks does damage control, Philly agencies launch probes

Following the incident ‚Äî which was captured on a Twitter video that has garnered more than nine million views ‚Äî Starbucks is in high-level damage control and two Philadelphia agencies have launched probes.

Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson issued a letter of apology to the two men late Saturday night and is en route to Philadelphia where he said he will join Hymes ‚Äúto speak with partners, customers and community leaders as well as law enforcement.‚Äù

‚ÄúMost importantly,‚Äù Johnson wrote in the letter, ‚ÄúI hope to meet personally with the two men who were arrested to offer a face-to-face apology.‚Äù

Johnson said the company is also reviewing its policies.

‚ÄúRegretfully, our practices and training led to a bad outcome ‚Äî the basis for the call to the Philadelphia police department was wrong,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúOur store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did.‚Äù

While Philadelphia Police Commissioner Ross said in a video posted to the department‚Äôs Facebook page that the officers ‚Äúdid absolutely nothing wrong‚Äù and ‚Äúfollowed policy,‚Äù the department has launched an internal investigation into the incident. Mayor Jim Kenney has asked the city‚Äôs Human Relations Commission to review Starbucks‚Äô policies and practices.

Attorney Lauren Wimmer, who is representing the two men, has not responded to multiple requests for comment, but told Fox29 on Sunday morning that her clients are ‚Äútraumatized.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis case speaks milestones about the racial controversies that we see every day in America, and that‚Äôs exactly what happened here,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis case, make no mistake about it, is about race.‚Äù

Wimmer said the two men were there to meet a third person, real estate investor Andrew Yaffe, who is white. Yaffe showed up at the Starbucks as the men were being arrested, and can be seen and heard on the Twitter video saying, ‚ÄúThis is ridiculous. What did they get called for, because there are two black guys sitting here meeting me?‚Äù

Reached by phone Sunday afternoon, Yaffe declined to comment.

Wimmer, who did not name the two men, said after they were arrested around 5:30 p.m. Thursday, they were taken to the nearby police district where they were held for about eight hours.

Around 12:30 a.m., she said the Philadelphia District Attorney‚Äôs Office informed her that it was declining to press charges due to a lack of evidence that the men had committed a crime.

Wimmer also criticized the PPD‚Äôs response and questioned why the department would send six officers to the scene.

‚ÄúThis should have been a conversation between one and two officers and the two gentlemen and that‚Äôs it. If it needed to be a conversation to be held outside of the Starbucks so they could diffuse the situation, that‚Äôs what should have been done.

Videos posted online show officers handcuffing the men in the downtown establishment on Thursday. A white man in the video is heard saying he was meeting with the men and calls the arrest ""ridiculous.""

Commissioner Richard Ross said Starbucks employees called 911 to say the men were trespassing. He said officers were told that the men had come in and asked to use the restroom but were denied because they hadn't bought anything, as he said is company policy. He said they then refused to leave.

Ross, who is black, said police asked the men to leave three times but they refused, and they were then arrested but were later released after the company elected not to prosecute. He said the officers ""did absolutely nothing wrong"" and were professional in their conduct toward the individuals but ""got the opposite back."" He did not mention the person who said he was meeting with the men.

""As an African American male, I am very aware of implicit bias; we are committed to fair and unbiased policing,"" Ross said. But he added ""If a business calls and they say that 'Someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business' (officers) now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties and they did just that.""

Starbucks posted an apology on Twitter Saturday, saying the company was ""disappointed this led to an arrest"" and was reviewing its policies.

""We take these matters seriously and clearly have more work to do when it comes to how we handle incidents in our store,"" the company said in a statement Saturday afternoon.

Ross said he doesn't patronize Starbucks but recalled an incident from a few years ago in which a uniformed sergeant was denied access to a Starbucks bathroom ""so they are at least consistent in their policy.""

Mayor Jim Kenney said he asked the city Commission on Human Relations to examine the company's policies and procedures ""including the extent of, or need for, implicit bias training for its employees.""

""I am heartbroken to see Philadelphia in the headlines for an incident that ‚Äî at least based on what we know at this point ‚Äî appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018,"" Kenney said in a statement.

Kenney said a review promised by police of policies in similar situations ""is fully warranted given the unfortunate outcome of this event, particularly at a time when our criminal justice reform efforts are focused on avoiding needless incarcerations.""

Attorney Lauren Wimmer told The Philadelphia Inquirer that the men, who she did not identify, were commercial real estate professionals and were meeting with the another man to discuss business. She identified herself as a friend of the man they were meeting with.

A spokesman for the district attorney's office said the two black men were released ""because of lack of evidence"" that a crime had been committed, but declined further comment, citing a police investigation."

When police arrived, two Starbucks employees told them two men had asked to use the restroom but were told they couldn't because they hadn't purchased anything. The men allegedly refused to leave after being asked by Starbucks employees. Ross also said the two men refused to leave after being asked three times by police officers.

So, Ross says, officers arrested the men. The attorney for the two men, Lauren Wimmer, told the Philadelphia Inquirer she received word that the two were being released from custody at 12:30 a.m. Friday, nearly eight hours after the initial 911 call. Ross confirmed that the officers released the men from custody after they discovered Starbucks was not planning to prosecute them.

In his statement, Ross said he believed the officers ""did absolutely nothing wrong."" He continued:

""[The police officers] followed policy, they did what they were supposed to do, they were professional in all their dealings with these gentlemen and instead, they got the opposite back. I will say that as an African American man, I am very aware of implicit bias. We are committed to fair and unbiased policing and anything less than that will not be tolerated in this department.""

Ross said all commanders in his department receive implicit bias training, and all new recruits are sent to both the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. ""We want them to know about the atrocities that were, in fact, committed by policing around the world,"" he says.

A police spokesman told the Inquirer that the Philadelphia Police Department's internal affairs unit is looking into the incident.

In a statement released Saturday, Philadelphia's mayor Jim Kenney criticized Starbucks for its role in the arrests:

""I am heartbroken to see Philadelphia in the headlines for an incident that ‚Äî at least based on what we know at this point ‚Äî appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018. For many, Starbucks is not just a place to buy a cup of coffee, but a place to meet up with friends or family members, or to get some work done. Like all retail establishments in our city, Starbucks should be a place where everyone is treated the same, no matter the color of their skin.""

The mayor's statement says Starbucks' apology, which the company issued on its Twitter account earlier Saturday, was not enough. Kenney also says he has asked the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations to look into whether additional implicit bias training should be required of Starbucks employees, and his office has reached out to Starbucks directly to discuss the matter."

Charges ultimately weren‚Äôt filed. Read more

The arrests of two black men at a Philadelphia Starbucks last week has prompted nationwide outrage, protests at the store at 18th and Spruce Streets and the departure of the manager who called police to the coffee shop.

If you're just catching up on the story, here's a guide to what happened to spark the controversy (follow along here for the latest developments on the situation):

The men were waiting for an acquaintance at a Center City Starbucks when they were arrested

The two men, whose identities remain unknown, were sitting at a table at the Starbucks at 18th and Spruce Streets on Thursday afternoon. They were waiting for an acquaintance, but didn't make any purchases. When they refused to leave, a store manager called police, who arrested both men and led them out of the store in handcuffs. No charges were filed, as Starbucks declined to prosecute.

Video of the arrest went viral

A video of the arrests was posted to Twitter by Philadelphia-based author Melissa DePino, which quickly went viral and sparked outrage nationwide. The video has been viewed nearly 10 million times.

Philadelphia real estate investor Andrew Yaffe asked why officers were called and attempted to explain to police that the two men were waiting for him.

""What did they get called for, because there were two black guys sitting here, meeting me?"" Yaffe asked. ""What did they do?""

Second video of the arrest show the two men were calm

A longer video of the two arrests shot from a different angle doesn't reveal anything before the moment police arrive. But it shows the two men remained calm throughout the entire encounter with police, including when they were handcuffed and led out of the store.

The second video also shows more of the back-and-forth between police officers and customers inside the Starbucks location, though the noise of the crowd makes it difficult to hear what was said.

Starbucks‚Äô CEO came to Philadelphia

In an interview with the Inquirer and Daily News, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson called incident ""reprehensible,"" vowing to work with store managers and employees to address any ""unconscious bias"" across the coffee chain. He made similar statements in an interview on Good Morning America.

Johnson is in Philadelphia, and said he hopes to offer a face-to-face apology to the two men. Johnson is also set to meet with Mayor Kenney and Police Commissioner Richard Ross and other community leaders Monday, a spokeswoman for the Seattle-based company said.

Philadelphia‚Äôs police chief said his officers did nothing wrong

In a video posted to Facebook on Saturday, Police Commissioner Richard Ross defended the officers involved in the arrest, stating they acted appropriately, though he added the incident was yet another reason the city should expand the department's body camera program.

""The police did not just happen upon this event ‚Äî they did not just walk into Starbucks to get a coffee,"" Ross said in a video posted to Facebook Saturday. ""They were called there, for a service, and that service had to do with quelling a disturbance, a disturbance that had to do with trespassing. These officers did absolutely nothing wrong.""

John McNesby, president of Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 5, also defended the officers involved in the incident, saying they ""acted very professionally.""

""I can't control what people think,"" McNesby said of the controversy surrounding the arrests, adding that the officers ""did their job.""

Police spokesman Troy T. Brown said the department's internal affairs investigation is ""active and ongoing.""

Mayor Kenney has called for a city review of Starbucks‚Äô policies

Kenney said in a statement calling for a review of Starbucks policies that the incident ""appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018.""

""Like all retail establishments in our city, Starbucks should be a place where everyone is treated the same, no matter the color of their skin,"" he said. ""Starbucks has issued an apology, but that is not enough."""

The quickly planned meeting came amid a second day of protests in the City of Brotherly Love, after video of the two getting arrested on suspicion of trespassing went viral.

A spokesperson for Starbucks confirmed to NBC News that the private meeting with CEO Kevin Johnson happened on Monday but no additional details were immediately provided.

On Monday morning, speaking to ABC‚Äôs ""Good Morning America,"" Johnson had called the arrests ""reprehensible"" and said he wanted to meet with the men to discuss ""a constructive solution.‚Äù

He also said he will order store managers to undergo training on how to spot ""unconscious bias"" ‚Äî something that has been implemented in many police departments across the nation as well as other corporations, such as Facebook, to help educate employees not act upon subconscious stereotypes.

Previously, Johnson appeared in a video apologizing to the men and promising changes at the company.

The two men, whose identities have not been released, were arrested Thursday after a Starbucks manager called 911 because they were sitting inside the store, had not bought anything and refused to leave, according to police.

The store manager who called police ""is no longer at that store,"" a Starbucks spokesman told NBC News Monday afternoon, but did not give any further detail. It was not immediately clear whether the manager had been fired.

About two dozen protesters gathered outside the coffee shop in the pouring rain, starting before 7 a.m. on Monday, alleging racism by both the baristas and the police. Inside the store it looked like business as usual, however most of the people sitting at the tables were regional leaders from the company's corporate side, according to The Associated Press.

Just before 7:30 a.m., the protesters moved inside and stood in front of the counter, some holding banners reading ""End Stop and Frisk"" and chanting slogans like, ""A whole lot of racism, a whole lot of crap, Starbucks coffee is anti-black.""

Protester Shani Robin told NBC News that the demonstrators want the manager who called police and the arresting officers fired.

‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt even go into a Starbucks to wait for a friend to come, you‚Äôre not safe anywhere,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWe're going to occupy space, we're going to make it very uncomfortable until they make changes and until specifically they meet the demands we set forth,‚Äù Robin added.

Another protester, Abdul-Aliy Muhammad, toldthe AP, ""We don't want this Starbucks to make any money today. That's our goal.""

While in Philadelphia on Monday, Johnson, the Starbucks CEO, met with Mayor Jim Kenney and other city leaders.

Kenney told reporters after the meeting that he was happy that the company met with officials and that Starbucks was ""contrite.""

""They're going to examine their guidelines and make sure that this doesn‚Äôt happen again and they were very contrite and sorry for what happened, and we‚Äôll work with them going forward,"" he said.

Councilman Kenyatta Johnson said during a news conference that he would ""wait and see"" if the company actually implemented change.

""To me it was all lip service. I'm not sold,"" he said.

The councilman, who is black, added that he wanted to ""see an actual plan"" to ensure that people could go to Starbucks ""without fear of being targeted because of their skin color.""

Also on Monday afternoon, the NAACP said in a statement that the arrests represented ""another ominous signal on the increasingly dangerous environment for African-Americans.""

""The Starbucks situation provides dangerous insight regarding the failure of our nation to take implicit bias seriously,"" the NAACP said.

On Sunday, demonstrators carried megaphones and signs with phrases like ‚ÄúToo Little Too Latte‚Äù and confronted the employees behind the register, according to NBC Philadelphia.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross, who is black, said Saturday that the men hadn't purchased anything and refused to leave, which led to the arrest. The men were eventually let go after about eight hours in police custody; Starbucks did not press any charges.

Michelle Saahene, who witnessed the incident, told NBC News on Sunday that after the men were not permitted to use the bathroom because they had not purchased anything, they sat at a table silently while using their phones as they waited for a friend.

""The cops were asking them to leave because they weren‚Äôt purchasing anything,"" Saahene said. ""This is a Starbucks. Since when are people asked to leave a Starbucks who are just sitting there?"""

Anger over two black men being perp-walked out of a Philadelphia Starbucks continued to simmer Monday, with protests that briefly shut the location down, a sit-in and critical comments from African-American leaders.

During the early demonstration that forced the store to close, protesters called the mammoth coffee chain ‚Äúanti-black.‚Äù The store reopened hours later.

As the protests heated up, the arrested men, who were not charged with a crime despite being detained, agreed to meet with Starbucks‚Äô CEO Kevin Johnson. And the Philadelphia police commissioner, who is under fire for defending his officers, said the policemen never wanted to arrest the men.

The men, who have not been identified, initially asked to use the restroom inside the Starbucks on Thursday but were told the cafe‚Äôs bathrooms were for customers only. They then occupied a table without making a purchase, which many observers have noted is a common occurrence at the franchise‚Äôs locations.

A manager called police after the men declined to leave the premises because, they said, they were waiting for an acquaintance.

That manager is no longer working at the store, Starbucks said, but it‚Äôs unclear if she was terminated or relocated.

‚ÄòWe want to see action‚Äô

Philadelphia Councilman Kenyatta Johnson and other African-American leaders denounced the chain Monday afternoon in front of the Rittenhouse Square location, where the incident occurred.

Johnson said he met with the Starbucks CEO and Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, but he was ‚Äúnot sold‚Äù on the actions Starbucks said it planned to take.

‚ÄúTo me it was all lip service,‚Äù said Johnson, whose district includes the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood.

‚ÄúWe want to see action,‚Äù the councilman said. ‚ÄúWe want to see an actual plan to make sure that those individuals that come to and from Starbucks ‚Ä¶ are respected, and they can go to the establishment without fear of being targeted because of their skin color.‚Äù

He said he believes if the two men ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have sweatsuits on, they wouldn‚Äôt have been targeted.‚Äù

Johnson said city leaders are also demanding Starbucks engage in diversity and inclusion training and sensitivity training for all workers.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt find a reason for them being approached by this except for their skin,‚Äù said Minister Rodney Muhammad, president of the Philadelphia NAACP.

‚ÄòThis is a societal issue‚Äô

Soon after, faith leaders and others filed into the store for a sit-in led by Philadelphians Organized to Witness, Empower and Rebuild, a community group. The crowd sang gospel songs and chanted before leaving the store.

As they prepared to march, one man said: ‚ÄúStarbucks, you can‚Äôt hide.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can see your dirty side,‚Äù the crowd responded.

Starbucks‚Äô policies, guidelines and procedures will be reviewed by the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations, the mayor‚Äôs office said. The city‚Äôs Police Advisory Commission has also been asked to review all video of the incident and interview citizens and officers at the scene.

After meeting with Starbucks officials, including its CEO, Kenney said he believes the company will cooperate with the city‚Äôs probes.

‚ÄúThis is not just a Starbucks issue. This is a societal issue,‚Äù Kenney said in a statement.‚Äù People can react differently to others based on skin color, and that is wrong. We have work to do, and we need to do so productively.‚Äù

‚ÄòIf we can‚Äôt get it, shut it down‚Äô

Hours earlier, a man also led protesters in call and response, in video captured by CNN affiliate KYW.

‚ÄúStarbucks coffee is anti-black!‚Äù

‚ÄúA whole lot of racism, a whole lot of crap!‚Äù

The next chant began, ‚ÄúAnti-blackness anywhere is anti-blackness everywhere!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do we want?‚Äù the man asked.

‚ÄúLiberation!‚Äù the protesters replied.

‚ÄúWhen do we want it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNow!‚Äù

The next chant ‚Äì ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt get it, shut it down‚Äù ‚Äì spoke to the demonstrators‚Äô demands. They are angry with Starbucks‚Äô apology and the company‚Äôs promise to review its policies.

CEO calls arrests ‚Äòreprehensible‚Äô

They bristled particularly at the sentence, ‚ÄúOur store manager never intended for these men to be arrested.‚Äù Why then, posited the protesters ‚Äì as did their counterparts on social media ‚Äì did the manager call police in the first place? And why, in the video of the arrests that went viral last week, is the manager not seen intervening, despite several customers taking the arresting officers to task?

Top cop: Men wouldn‚Äôt leave coffee shop

In the KYW video, a woman protesting in the store Monday tells customers, employees and her fellow protesters, ‚ÄúWe are here today not just to bring attention to what Starbucks has done but to bring more attention, as if we needed it, to what the PPD continues to do. So we are very clear that corporations aren‚Äôt here for us and we‚Äôre also clear that the Philadelphia Police Department is not here for us, either.‚Äù

Other protesters off camera chime in, saying, ‚ÄúNot at all‚Äù and ‚ÄúNever been, never been.‚Äù

Police Commissioner Richard Ross has said previously his officers did nothing wrong and performed only ‚Äúa service that they were called to do.‚Äù

On Monday, in an interview with CNN affiliate WPVI, Ross called the arrests ‚Äúvery unfortunate‚Äù and said his officers tried to avoid making an arrest but were left with no choice but to handcuff the men.

It‚Äôs common for officers to respond to reports that someone won‚Äôt leave a business, he said, adding that, typically, the person or people leave before police get there or when they arrive.

‚ÄúMost people will move just simply because we tell them the proprietor wants you to leave. In this case, that was not the issue, and that‚Äôs for them to decide why they didn‚Äôt do that,‚Äù he told the station. ‚ÄúThere are laws on the books that we have to follow. If we had our druthers, we wouldn‚Äôt (have) come there in the first place. That‚Äôs just keeping it simple.‚Äù

Protesters, Starbucks VP face off

The protesters did not appear to see any temperance in the officers‚Äô actions, however. On their Facebook page ‚Äì titled ‚ÄúShut Down Starbucks!‚Äù ‚Äì they alleged the Philadelphia police ‚Äúhave once again demonstrated their inherent white supremacy and inability to serve the black community.‚Äù

They demand the Starbucks manager who called police be fired and that the officers who arrested the men face the same fate.

They also want an official apology to the men and the black community at large and demand that ‚ÄúStarbucks create and publicize a new policy that expressly disallows calling the police on citizens,‚Äù according to the Facebook page.

When Camille Hymes, a regional vice president for the coffee behemoth, asked to speak to protesters in the store Monday, she was rebuffed.

‚ÄúWe know that you don‚Äôt have the power to change everything. You‚Äôre just a figurehead, but we‚Äôre going to get to those in power and we‚Äôre going to make sure that we shut you down,‚Äù a protester told Hymes in the KYW video.

On Sunday, another KYW video showed Hymes asking protesters to leave the store when her conversation with them went sideways.

‚ÄúWe put (the manager) in a position that did not allow her to be set up for success or those two men,‚Äù Hymes told the crowd, explaining that Starbucks‚Äô policies, and not its employees, drove the arrests.

A man in the store yelled, ‚ÄúThey got a picture in the system now! They‚Äôre fingerprinted!‚Äù

Asa Khalif of Black Lives Matter in Pennsylvania refused to let the manager off the hook, telling Hymes, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a racist bigot. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm calling her that. Until that element is removed from this store, there cannot be any dialogue. There can only be protest.‚Äù

Someone in the background asked Hymes, ‚ÄúCan you understand the lack of empathy for the manager when‚Ä¶,‚Äù but she didn‚Äôt finish her question.

‚ÄúAt this time, we‚Äôll ask that you step outside,‚Äù Hymes told the protesters.

CEO doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äòpoint blame‚Äô

In an interview with WPVI, Khalif summed up protesters‚Äô anger.

‚ÄúBlack people are met with aggression every time we are encountered with police. What that manager did was she put those men in danger,‚Äù he told the station.

Starbucks CEO Johnson said in an apology posted on Facebook that he believes ‚Äúthat blame is misplaced.‚Äù On ‚ÄúGood Morning America,‚Äù he said he did not want to ‚Äúpoint blame‚Äù for the arrests.

‚ÄúMy responsibility is to look not only at that individual but to look more broadly at the circumstances that set that up, to ensure that this never happens again,‚Äù he told ‚ÄúGMA.‚Äù

The timing of the meeting between Johnson and the two men who were arrested has yet to be determined. A spokesperson said it will ideally take place this week."

The protests followed the release of a video that showed the two men being arrested after a store manager called the police because they were sitting in the store without placing an order. The two said they were waiting for a friend who arrived just as they were taken away in handcuffs.

Witnesses said the two were refused access to the bathroom because they had not made a purchase but that another customer had just used the bathroom without buying anything. Another said she had been there for hours without making a purchase.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want this Starbucks to make any money today. That‚Äôs our goal,‚Äù said Abdul-Aliy Muhammad, one of the protest‚Äôs organizers and co-founder of the Black and Brown Workers Collective, as protesters moved to the front counter shortly after 7am and chanted ‚ÄúStarbucks coffee is anti-black‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe are gonna shut you down‚Äù.

The arrests have caused a PR crisis for Starbucks. Kevin Johnson, Starbucks‚Äô CEO, said he was hoping to meet the mayor, police and hopefully the men who were arrested in an interview on Monday on ABC‚Äôs Good Morning America. Johnson called the arrests ‚Äúreprehensible‚Äù.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to have a dialogue with them so that I can ensure that we have opportunity to really understand the situation and show some compassion and empathy for the experience they went through,‚Äù he said.

The protesters gathered outside the store in the pouring rain, while inside it looked like business as usual. However, most people drinking coffee at the tables were regional leaders for the company‚Äôs corporate side.

Just before 7.30am, the protesters moved inside and stood in front of the counter, some holding banners reading ‚ÄúEnd Stop and Frisk‚Äù, chanting slogans such as: ‚ÄúA whole lot of racism, a whole lot of crap, Starbucks coffee is anti-black.‚Äù

Speeches decried police brutality and gentrification. Starbucks regional vice-president Camille Hymes attempted to talk to the protesters, but was shouted down.

Over the weekend, demonstrators called for the firing of the employee who had contacted police. Starbucks has removed the manager from the store and said told The Philadelphia Inquirer the separation was ‚Äúmutual‚Äù.

Officials have said police officers were told the men had asked to use the store‚Äôs restroom but were denied because they had not bought anything and they refused to leave.

Police have not released the names of the men who were arrested and later released after the district attorney‚Äôs office said there was lack of evidence that a crime had been committed.

Over the weekend, the mayor of Philadelphia ordered a city commission to review policies at Starbucks after the arrests prompted social media users to accuse the company of racial discrimination.

Protesters gathered outside the branch in downtown Philadelphia on Sunday, with a local preacher leading several dozen in chants of ‚ÄúI am somebody, and I demand equality now‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is a shame that [in] the year 2018 we‚Äôre still putting up with this mess,‚Äù said the Rev Jeffrey Jordan. ‚ÄúThis country was built on the backs of black and brown people and now Starbucks is going to treat us like we‚Äôre second class.‚Äù

The arrests on Thursday were captured on video and circulated widely on social media.

The police commissioner, Richard Ross, said officers went to the coffee shop after Starbucks employee reported the men were trespassing. Officers were told the men had entered and asked to use the toilet, but were refused because they had not bought anything. They then refused to leave. Ross, who is black, insisted that his officers ‚Äúdid absolutely nothing wrong‚Äù.

Police have not released the names of the men. A spokesman for the district attorney‚Äôs office said the two were released ‚Äúbecause of lack of evidence‚Äù that a crime had been committed, but declined to comment further, citing a police investigation.

Johnson said the company‚Äôs practices and training led to a ‚Äúbad outcome‚Äù, and the reason for the call that brought police into the shop was incorrect.

He said the company would further train workers on when to call police and host a company-wide meeting to ‚Äúunderscore our longstanding commitment to treating one another with respect and dignity‚Äù.

He said he wanted to apologize to them in person ‚Äúand show some compassion and empathy for the experience they went through.‚Äù Johnson added that he would like to invite them to join him in finding ‚Äúa constructive way to solve this issue.‚Äù

The interview was the third time Johnson has publicly apologized for the company‚Äôs role in the Philadelphia Starbucks store incident.

Johnson, who has called the arrests ""reprehensible,"" arrived in Philadelphia this weekend after video of the arrests gained traction online. He said he hopes to meet with the two men in the next couple of days and apologize to them face-to-face.

""I'd like to have a dialogue with them and the opportunity to listen to them with compassion and empathy through the experience they went through,"" said Johnson, who has been CEO about a year. A lawyer for the two men who were arrested didn't immediately return a call for comment.

The incident is a major blow to Starbucks' image, since the company has promoted its coffee shops as neighborhood hangouts where anyone is welcome. After a video of the arrests spread online, the hashtag #BoycottStarbucks trended on Twitter.

And on Monday, about two dozen protesters took over the Philadelphia shop, chanting slogans like, ""A whole lot of racism, a whole lot of crap, Starbucks coffee is anti-black."" A Starbucks regional vice president who attempted to talk to the protesters was shouted down.

""We don't want this Starbucks to make any money today. That's our goal,"" said Abdul-Aliy Muhammad, one of the protest's organizers and co-founder of the Black and Brown Workers Collective.

Over the weekend, demonstrators called for the firing of the employee who contacted police, who arrested the men on Thursday. Starbucks did not immediately respond to a request to confirm a report that the manager who called police had left the company.

Officials have said police officers were told the men had asked to use the store's restroom but were denied because they hadn't bought anything and they refused to leave.

Video shows several police talking quietly with two black men seated at a table. After a few minutes, officers handcuff the men and lead them outside as other customers say they weren't doing anything wrong. A white man identified as real estate developer Andrew Yaffe arrives and tells the officers the two men were waiting for him. An officer says the men were not complying and were being arrested for trespassing.

""Why would they be asked to leave?"" Yaffe says. ""Does anybody else think this is ridiculous? It's absolute discrimination.""

A woman can be heard in the video saying ""they didn't do anything, I saw the entire thing.""

Police haven't released the names of the men, who were later released after the district attorney's office said there was lack of evidence that a crime had been committed.

Johnson said the company will ensure that employee guidelines on when the police should be called will be clarified.

Asked if the incident was a case of racism, Johnson responded: ""Starbucks was built around the concept of a third place where we create a warm and welcoming environment for all customers. What I do know is that did not happen in this instance. And that is what we're focused on.""

Philadelphia-born comedian Kevin Hart had taken to Twitter on Monday to vent about the arrests, saying the company failed to take advantage of an opportunity to call out racial profiling. He says the employee who called police should have been fired.

On Sunday he tweeted ""Our city is shining bright like a diamond right now. Please make this situation right.""

Seattle-based Starbucks had posted a statement on Twitter over the weekend about the arrests, followed by an apology from Johnson.

""Every company makes mistakes, but great companies are the ones that learn from those mistakes and take appropriate action,"" Johnson said Monday. ""And that's exactly what I intend to do. We're reviewing all aspects of this."""

Police said a Starbucks manager called 911 Thursday because the men refused to leave after trying to use the store's restroom without making a purchase. They were arrested for alleged trespassing. Those two men claim they were in Starbucks for a business meeting and were waiting for someone.

Attorney Stewart Cohen, who represents the two men, said this was a clear case of racial profiling.

""When I walk in and I don't order anything and I'm dressed like this, no manager is calling the police on me,"" Cohen told CBS News correspondent Michelle Miller.



""If they were white, would this have happened?"" Miller asked.

""None of the white customers were asked to leave, and they were there a lot longer than those young men who were just there for a few minutes,"" Cohen said.

Starbucks often touts its initiatives on race and diversity, but now it's under pressure from activists and protesters gathering outside the Philadelphia store for a second day in a row. Activists accused both Starbucks and Philadelphia police of racism.

""We'll work very hard to ensure that we evaluate our training,"" said Camille Hymes, a Starbucks regional vice president.

In a statement, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson called the arrests ""reprehensible."" ""Our store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did,"" he said.



Philadelphia police commissioner Richard Ross defended the officers, saying, ""These officers did absolutely nothing wrong.""

""It is important to emphasize and underscore that these officers had legal standing to make this arrest,"" Ross said.



Author Melissa DePino tweeted out one of the videos because she was upset by how the men were treated.



""People who I know in my everyday life have said things like, 'I can't believe that really happens!'"" DePino said. ""I want people to listen to people who experience it and to understand that it's real.""

The company confirmed the meeting to CBS News but did not release any details. Starbucks also said meetings took place with the mayor, police commissioner, and other community members.

Meanwhile nearly two dozen protesters took over the shop Monday, demanding answers and changes to the company's policy of calling police.

CENTER CITY -- The chief executive officer of Starbucks says he will order managers of the coffee giant's stores to undergo training on how to spot ""unconscious bias"" after witnesses said two black men were arrested at a Philadelphia shop for doing nothing but sitting at a table.

""I'll say the circumstances surrounding the incident and the outcome at our store on Thursday were reprehensible,"" Starbucks' CEO Kevin Johnson said in an exclusive interview with ABC News' ""Good Morning America"" today. ""They were wrong, and for that, I personally apologize to the gentlemen that visited our store.""

Johnson was in Philadelphia this morning, a day after protesters rallied Sunday at the downtown Philadelphia Starbucks, where the two black men, who have yet to be identified, were led out in handcuffs by police and accused of trespassing.

The demonstrators demanded Starbucks fire the manager of the store for calling the police.

As Johnson was being interviewed on ""GMA,"" about two dozen protesters were at the downtown Philadelphia Starbucks chanting, ""A whole lot of racism, a whole lot of crap, Starbucks coffee is anti-black.""

""We don't want this Starbucks to make any money today. That's our goal,"" Abdul-Aliy Muhammad, one of the protest's organizers and co-founder of the Black and Brown Workers Collective, told The Associated Press.

Starbucks CEO expected to meet arrested men. Jeannette Reyes reports during Action News Mornings on April 16, 2018.

In response, the company's CEO said this morning, Starbucks will conduct a thorough investigation of the incident and hopes to ask the two men who were arrested to ""join me in finding a constructive way to solve this issue.""

Johnson said he has yet to speak to the men, who have retained an attorney.

""Clearly, there's an opportunity for us to provide clarity and in addition to that I'd say there's training, more training that we're going to do with our store managers, not only around the guidelines but training around unconscious bias,"" Johnson said.

The 28,000 Starbucks store across the nation may have slightly different regional guidelines on how to handle situations that warrant police intervention, he added.

""Now, there are some scenarios where the police should be called. If there's threats or disturbance, those may be appropriate times,"" Johnson said. ""In this case, none of that occurred. It was completely inappropriate to engage the police.""

The arrests of the men were captured on video and tweeted by Melissa DePino, a 50-year-old mother of two who told ABC News she's vowed not to patronize Starbucks again. The video has since been viewed more than 9 million times.

""It was humiliating for those guys,"" DePino said. ""They were completely minding their own business.""

Both men were later released and the charges they were facing -- trespassing and disturbance -- were dropped Thursday night.

Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner also refused to prosecute after Starbucks asked to not press charges.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross Jr. said in a video testimonial released by the police department Saturday that his officers ""did absolutely nothing wrong.""

""I can tell you candidly these officers did a service they were called to do,"" he said.

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney slammed Starbucks for the incident, saying it ""appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018.""

Johnson, the CEO, said Starbucks accepts full responsibility for what occurred.

""Starbucks was built as a company that creates a warm, welcoming environment for all customers,"" he told ""GMA.""

""That didn't happen in this case. That, I know. And so it's my responsibility to ensure that we review everything. We review the actions of the store manager, we review the guidelines that were provided and we review and invest in the training necessary to ensure that doesn't happen again.""

Demonstrators carried megaphones and signs that said phrases like, ‚ÄúToo Little Too Latte,‚Äù and confronted the employees behind the register, according to NBC Philadelphia.

The original incident occurred on Thursday, when a Starbucks employee called 911 because two black men were sitting inside the caf√©. Soon after they arrived, police handcuffed the men and escorted them out of the shop.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross, who is black, said the men hadn't purchased anything and refused to leave, which led to the arrest.

@Starbucks The police were called because these men hadn‚Äôt ordered anything. They were waiting for a friend to show up, who did as they were taken out in handcuffs for doing nothing. All the other white ppl are wondering why it‚Äôs never happened to us when we do the same thing. pic.twitter.com/0U4Pzs55Ci ‚Äî Melissa DePino (@missydepino) April 12, 2018

A video of the arrest and ensuing confusion went viral on Twitter.

Michelle Saahene witnessed the entire event, as she‚Äôd been at the Starbucks for nearly an hour. She told NBC News on Sunday that, as a black woman, she was slightly nervous when the police officers entered the coffee shop, but she was then as shocked as the two men when they were approached by the members of law enforcement.

After the two men were refused the bathroom, they just sat at a table silently and played with their phones as they waited for a friend, Saahene told NBC News.

""The cops were asking them to leave because they weren‚Äôt purchasing anything,"" Saahene said. ""[The two men] said they were confused. This is a Starbucks. Since when are people asked to leave a Starbucks who are just sitting there?""

Saahene said that a white man sitting next to her had been at the Starbucks for 30 minutes without making a purchase and a jogger came in and used the bathroom without making a purchase.

That‚Äôs one of the reasons she felt compelled to approach the employee who called 911.

‚Äú‚ÄôDid you feel threatened‚Äô?‚Äù she said she asked the Starbucks barista. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt look at me. ‚ÄòDid you feel like your life was threatened?‚Äô She still didn‚Äôt look at me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI got to the other side of the Starbucks and yelled, ‚Äòyou‚Äôre a coward!‚Äô‚Äù Saahene added.

Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson swiftly apologized that the 911 call was made and that the two men were arrested. He said that the company planned to investigate the matter and retrain its staff, but said the store manager ‚Äúnever intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did.‚Äù

""Creating an environment that is both safe and welcoming for everyone is paramount for every store,"" Johnson said. ""Regretfully, our practices and training led to a bad outcome ‚Äî the basis for the call to the Philadelphia police department was wrong. Our store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did.""

But many remained unhappy with the chain. Rather than taking to the streets, however, they shared their displeasure on social media.

Saahene, meanwhile, said she was overwhelmed by the support she received from the multiple white women who stood with her and then walked out of the Starbucks with her. They helped bring attention to the injustice of the situation, she said.

""That‚Äôs so important because for us to be successful we need those in the majority to take a stand,"" Saahene said. ""We as minorities have been crying for help have been pushing for social justice, but it‚Äôs not going to get better until we have the majority standing up for us."""
https://time.com/5241671/starbucks-philadelphia-bathroom-rights/,Want to Use the Starbucks Bathroom? These Are Your Rights,16/04/2018,https://time.com,"Starbucks‚Äòs reputation for being a place where people can hang out ‚Äî whether for a few minutes between appointments or for hours while they finish up a project ‚Äî is at the center of public outrage after two black men were arrested in a Philadelphia Starbucks store on Thursday.

The men were waiting for someone at the Philadelphia Starbucks store and had not purchased anything before the arrest. Police officials said they were not allowed to use the restroom because they did not buy anything, and a store manager called Philadelphia police after the men refused to leave. A video shot by a woman sitting at a table opposite from the men shows police officers talking to and then handcuffing the men, as a man asks police, ‚ÄúWhat did they do?‚Äù Multiple witnesses to the Philadelphia Starbucks arrest said the men didn‚Äôt do anything wrong.

‚ÄúThis is ridiculous,‚Äù a man in the video, who said he was there to meet the men, is heard saying. ‚ÄúWhat did they get called for? Because there are two black guys sitting here meeting me?‚Äù

Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson apologized after the arrests, saying Monday on Good Morning America that the Philadelphia store‚Äôs guidelines outlined scenarios in which calling the police is the right move. But ‚Äúit was completely inappropriate to engage the police,‚Äù in this particular situation, he said, noting that employees will now have more training, particularly against unconscious bias.

It‚Äôs not always clear whether sitting in a Starbucks or using a Starbucks restroom without purchasing any items is allowed. A company spokesperson said Starbucks does not have a broad policy prohibiting people from using restrooms or sitting inside for free, allowing individual stores to set their own rules. Populations density plays a part too ‚Äî it‚Äôs a little easier for people to wait unnoticed inside a more crowded Starbucks in a place like New York City without paying and than it is in sparser locations where policies can be enforced more strictly.

The Philadelphia Starbucks store where the arrest occurred has a rule in place that customers can only use restrooms if they purchase something. Such rules would allow Starbucks to ask people to leave ‚Äî under federal law, businesses like Starbucks can refuse service for reasons other than discrimination. But they can only protect a company to a point, according to Virginia-based attorney Matthew Kreitzer.

‚ÄúIt was certainly a reckless move on their part,‚Äù Kreitzer tells TIME in reference to the Starbucks store manager who called the police. ‚ÄúEven if they did not have a discriminatory motive, you‚Äôre still going to open yourself up to liability when you do things like that.‚Äù

Kreitzer says simply having a store policy that prohibits people from loitering or using the bathroom is useless if that rule is not applied on a consistent basis. For example, if a store is using its policy against only black customers but not applying it to white ones, that‚Äôs a basis for a discrimination case.

‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre targeting people and just using the rule as a scapegoat they‚Äôre still in trouble,‚Äù he says.

The video of the arrest went viral, putting Starbucks in the spotlight as people accused the company of racial discrimination both online and in person. Calls to boycott Starbucks poured in online, while protesters flooded the Philadelphia Starbucks store over the weekend. On Twitter, several black men and women weighed in and opened up about their own anxieties about spending time in public places like Starbucks.

It got me thinking about the roots of my reluctance at going into any store/shop/bar/etc if I'm not planning on buying anything. I know it's annoyed people in the past. But I don't feel comfortable just hanging out because most places get immediately suspicious of black men ‚Äî Joel D. Anderson üÜì (@byjoelanderson) April 14, 2018"

Starbucks Corp., which spent years touting its commitment to social justice, is scrambling to restore trust in the coffee chain after the arrest of two black patrons in Philadelphia.

Chief Executive Kevin Johnson has apologized for the incident, which involved an employee calling police after the two men waited at a Starbucks table without ordering. That was a ‚Äúreprehensible outcome,‚Äù he said in a statement over the weekend.

Johnson followed up with a video message in which he vowed to reassess Starbucks‚Äô policies and practices. The Seattle company also may adopt more store manager training, including instructions about unconscious bias, he said.

‚ÄúI will fix this,‚Äù said Johnson, 57. ‚ÄúThis is not who we are, and this is not who we‚Äôre going to be.‚Äù

Starbucks also confirmed in an email that the Philadelphia store manager doesn‚Äôt work at that location anymore. Previously, Johnson said that person was not to blame.

The controversy represents one of the first major tests for Johnson, who took the job from longtime CEO Howard Schultz a year ago. The company has prided itself on building community and fighting for social causes, but its actions have been called into question before. Under Schultz, Starbucks had baristas write ‚Äúrace together‚Äù on customers‚Äô cups, aiming to spur a discussion on U.S. race relations. The move was slammed on social media for being a ham-fisted approach to a complex issue.

Johnson also is confronting a growth slowdown, hurt in part by sluggish business during afternoon hours. Comparable sales ‚Äî a key measure ‚Äî rose just 2% in the company‚Äôs most recently reported quarter.

There are about 28,000 Starbucks cafes around the world, and local practices can vary widely. In Philadelphia, the company‚Äôs regional vice president, Camille Hymes, has been tasked with speaking to employees, customers, community leaders and law enforcement about the incident.

‚ÄúI think they‚Äôve done a good job of damage control,‚Äù said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones.

Johnson also said he hoped to meet the two men who were arrested and apologize in person.

Stewart Cohen, the lawyer for the two men, said he hopes ‚Äúsomething productive for the community‚Äù can come out of such a meeting.

On Monday morning, about two dozen protesters took over the Philadelphia shop, chanting slogans that included, ‚ÄúStarbucks coffee is anti-black.‚Äù A Starbucks regional vice president who tried to talk to the protesters was shouted down.

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, who met with Johnson on Monday, said the city will review its guidelines on how to respond to future requests for police assistance.

Police haven‚Äôt announced the names of the two men who were arrested Thursday. They were released after the district attorney‚Äôs office said there was lack of evidence that a crime had been committed.

All this after video of last Thursday's incident went viral. The clip shows police officers confronting two black men seated inside the Starbucks as they wait for a third guest. The store manager reportedly called police after the men asked to use the bathroom without buying anything first.

Minutes of calm conversation follow. Police officers eventually handcuff both men and force them to leave. Starbucks' Kevin Johnson today called the arrests reprehensible, apologized to the men, and vowed to make sure this didn't happen again.

Police haven‚Äôt announced the names of the men, who were released after the district attorney‚Äôs office said there was lack of evidence that a crime had been committed.

Asked if the incident was a case of racism, Johnson responded: ‚ÄúStarbucks was built around the concept of a third place where we create a warm and welcoming environment for all customers. What I do know is that did not happen in this instance. And that is what we‚Äôre focused on.‚Äù

Philadelphia-born comedian Kevin Hart had taken to Twitter on Monday to vent about the arrests, saying the company failed to take advantage of an opportunity to call out racial profiling. He says the employee who called police should have been fired.

On Sunday he tweeted, ‚ÄúOur city is shining bright like a diamond right now. Please make this situation right.‚Äù

Seattle-based Starbucks had posted a statement on Twitter over the weekend about the arrests, followed by an apology from Johnson.

‚ÄúEvery company makes mistakes, but great companies are the ones that learn from those mistakes and take appropriate action,‚Äù Johnson said Monday. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs exactly what I intend to do. We‚Äôre reviewing all aspects of this.‚Äù

As a black man who was kicked out of a coffee shop in 2015, I had some thoughts when I heard about the two black men being kicked out and arrested for loitering in a Starbucks in Philadelphia recently. For the record, I wasn‚Äôt kicked out of a Starbucks. I was kicked out of The Elmwood Cafe, an independently owned and operated coffee shop in Berkeley, California. While the right (alt and otherwise) would have you believe that Berkeley is the liberal utopia, those of us who live out here know that‚Äôs not true ‚Äì at least we hope this isn‚Äôt what a liberal utopia is.

W. Kamau Bell

My story is in many ways the same as the two black men in Philadelphia. Days after it happened I wrote about it. I also told the story on ‚ÄúThis American Life‚Äù and wrote about it in my book. But my story is also markedly different. No one called the cops on me, but I do remember being nervous that was a possibility. And in January 2015, when I was kicked out, the news was filled with stories of Ferguson, Missouri, after the killing of Michael Brown by a Ferguson cop named Darren Wilson, so what could have happened if the police had shown up was front and center on my mind. I can‚Äôt imagine what those black men in Philadelphia went through, being locked up until 1:30 in the morning. I can, but I don‚Äôt really want to.

Our stories are similar in a couple of ways. We both had white women step up to get involved. The white woman in their situation is Melissa DePino, who tweeted the video of the arrest and has spoken out about what she witnessed. That is the only reason we are all talking about it right now. In my case I had a ringer, my wife. She was there when I was kicked out of The Elmwood Cafe. In fact, in a weird way it was her fault I was kicked out, because I was kicked out for talking to her. They thought I was trying to sell her something. I was showing her and her friends a new children‚Äôs book I had just bought about Mildred and Richard Loving, the couple who is responsible for making interracial marriage legal throughout the country. And if that doesn‚Äôt seem corny enough, it was also my birthday! ‚ÄúHappy Birthday! The Elmwood Cafe got you some racism!‚Äù

The other way in which my situation is similar to the black men in Philly is the playbook that Starbucks is running is eerily similar to the one The Elmwood Cafe ran:

1. Initial hastily thrown together, ham-fisted, and unsatisfying apology

2. ‚ÄúResponsible parties‚Äù getting fired

3. Initial apology is replaced with a better apology that promises change and a new day

I don‚Äôt know if the next thing on Starbucks list is going to be the same as The Elmwood Cafe yet. There hasn‚Äôt been enough time. To be absolutely clear, the next thing on The Elmwood Cafe‚Äôs list was:

4. Wait for the media backlash to blow over and the return to business as usual while making but not measurably adhering to ANY OF THE CHANGES PROMISED.

After the better apology, my wife, Michael Pearce (the owner of The Elmwood Cafe), a cadre of activists, and I had a community forum on racism in Berkeley at a middle school. The owner promised to end implicit bias in his cafe, then in the stores on his block, then in the neighborhood, then in Berkeley, then I guess eventually in the entire the galaxy. For those not on the cutting edge of rebranding the worst of society‚Äôs ills, ‚Äúimplicit bias‚Äù basically means racism where nobody dies or needs to go to the hospital. At the community forum, when Pearce announced his plans he added that he and I were doing this together. I immediately looked over at him like, ‚ÄúWe are???‚Äù He put my reputation on that line. After the meeting I repeatedly followed up with him about ‚Äúour plans.‚Äù He quickly stopped returning my emails. The website he built, ImplicitBiasTraining.com, is currently just a white space, surrounded by yellow. If there is a better visual representation for white cowardice than whiteness engulfed in yellow, I don‚Äôt know what it could be.

So we have yet to find out if Starbucks will just wait for this heat to blow over and go back to business as usual, but believe me, people of color (and woke white folk) won‚Äôt be surprised if that is what they do. That‚Äôs why people were outside the Philly Starbucks this weekend. That‚Äôs why the hashtag #BoycottStarbucks is trending. People know that if you don‚Äôt actively hold companies accountable for their actions, then you believe they will just change things on their own. Remember, it was not that long ago that Starbucks was trying to end racism by writing on their cups. What did they do after that failed? They just went back to business as usual. But this time we can‚Äôt let that happen. Because these gentlemen‚Äôs story isn‚Äôt that unique and it isn‚Äôt just limited to coffee shops. Every day black people find themselves in simple situations where suddenly out of nowhere, we are treated like criminals. This Starbucks situation is not that far removed from Brennan Walker, the black teenager who was shot at by a man just for asking for directions.

That‚Äôs why I am against just firing the employees who are deemed the guilty parties. That just makes the employees the scapegoats for America‚Äôs entire history of institutionalized and structural racism. This isn‚Äôt just about a couple of rogue baristas ignoring the employee manual. I‚Äôm sure the Starbucks manual says, ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT BE RACIST/SEXIST/ABLEIST/TRANSPHOBIC/HOMOPHOBIC/JERKHOLE-IC!‚Äù all over it. It has to. Starbucks is a major corporation. But I‚Äôm guessing the manual doesn‚Äôt tell its employees how not to be racist/sexist/ableist/transphobic/homophobic/jerkhole-ic. This is key. I remember how the owner of The Elmwood Cafe told me that he didn‚Äôt train his employees to be racist. But he didn‚Äôt have to train be to be racist for them to act in racist ways. You have to un-train people. Racism is baked into America‚Äôs cake. It is the flour, the white, bleached flour.

So if Starbucks wants to truly make a difference, then they need to not just commit to ending discrimination in their coffee shops, they need to commit to being advocates for ending discrimination in America. If they can get us all to pay five bucks for coffee, this should be no big deal. Or they can just be like The Elmwood Cafe in Berkeley and let it blow over and get back to business as usual. My family and I haven‚Äôt been back to The Elmwood Cafe since. I fell in love with small double shot, no whip, mochas at Starbucks, but if they don‚Äôt make real lasting changes, I can get them many, many, many other places.

An earlier version of this commentary incorrectly stated that Melissa DePino recorded the video. She did not. She posted it to Twitter with written permission of the person who recorded it."
https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/waiting-while-black-philadelphia-can-get-you,Waiting While Black in Philadelphia Can Get You Arrested,16/04/2018,https://www.aclu.org,"Late last week, two Black men in Philadelphia were doing what people do every day in this city ‚Äî they waited in a coffee shop to meet an associate. While they were engaged in this mundane activity, they were removed from the Starbucks cafe at 18th and Spruce Streets in handcuffs by Philadelphia police officers.

This is another example of the kind of daily indignities that African-Americans face every day in Philadelphia and around the country. We can‚Äôt even wait in a coffee shop for a friend without the possibility that someone will call the police. Two days after the news broke of the incident, I‚Äôm angrier now than I was when I first heard about it.

The neighborhood where this incident occurred is known as Rittenhouse Square. For those not familiar with Philadelphia, it‚Äôs a tony neighborhood of beautiful townhouses and high-end apartment buildings.

It‚Äôs also the neighborhood with the highest rates of racial disparities in stops and frisks by police in all of Philadelphia. In 2010, the ACLU of Pennsylvania sued the city because the Philadelphia Police Department‚Äôs use of stop-and-frisk was discriminatory. Our data showed that African-Americans were far more likely to be stopped and frisked than their white counterparts. Making matters worse, those stops were often without any justifiable cause.

A year later, the city agreed to a consent decree to settle the case. That agreement requires the city to collect data on the PPD‚Äôs use of stop-and-frisk ‚Äî including the demographic information of people who are stopped and the reasons why they were stopped ‚Äî as well as to train officers to eliminate bias-based policing.

The police service area where the Starbucks is located has a Black population of just 3 percent. But 67 percent of the stops that occurred there in the first half of 2017 were of African-Americans. The two other police service areas in this district ‚Äî known as District 9 ‚Äî show similar lopsided disparities. In one of the bordering police service areas, a whopping 84 percent of pedestrians stopped were African-Americans in a neighborhood with a Black population of 16 percent.

Seven years after the city agreed to do better, we still see consistent racial disparities in stops and frisks. Yet, in a video statement in response to the incident, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross had the nerve to say that his officers ‚Äúdid absolutely nothing wrong.‚Äù

His statement, the data the city has collected on stops, and this incident all lead me to wonder if Ross and his department leaders in this district and this police service area, Capt. Danielle Vales and Lt. Jeffrey Rabinovitch, are serious about ending racial profiling in this neighborhood and throughout the city.

There was no need for a Starbucks employee to call 911 because two men were waiting for an associate in their store. And even after the police were called, the police did not have to end the situation by arresting these men. If Commissioner Ross is right that these officers followed policy, then the policy needs to change. Starbucks may be able to decide who sits in its store, but only the police could decide to arrest these men.

Racial bias and discrimination are so steeped in American culture that those of us who experience it on a regular basis have learned to live as second-class citizens in the country of our birth. Many folks have expressed pride or relief because the two men remained calm. I get that. I am glad, too. We have seen far too many incidents that have quickly spiraled out of control.

But there is an ugly side to that as well. Black people, men in particular, are not allowed the full range of emotional expression in public spaces. Even when an emotion other than being calm is warranted, we have been taught and have learned to police our emotions. No matter how badly we are being treated or how much our dignity is being assailed, we have to be the ones maintaining control and being responsible for de-escalating these situations.

We are not allowed to be angry. Or loud. Or boisterous. Or too happy or too celebratory. In other words, we‚Äôre not allowed to be human. We police ourselves because we know that others are already policing us. That, too, takes a toll.

As this story has gathered attention over the last three days, many people are doing backflips to justify what happened here. It is well past time to quit making excuses for racist behavior. Enough with the rationalizations and alternative theories. Believe us. We are credible messengers of our own truths and lived experiences. We shouldn‚Äôt have to rely on a white person or a video to validate us."
https://whyy.org/segments/by-admitting-fault-in-arrest-of-two-black-men-at-rittenhouse-starbucks-company-may-spare-itself-long-term-damage-to-brand/,"By admitting fault in arrest of two black men at Rittenhouse Starbucks, company may spare itself long-term damage to brand",16/04/2018,https://whyy.org,"The coffeeshop soundtrack is usually a reliable mix of inoffensive indie rock, porcelain clinking on countertops, and the caffeinated chitter chat of customers. But over the weekend and continuing on Monday, the playlist at the Starbuck on the corner of 18th and Spruce Streets has been dominated by protest songs, angry chants, and bullhorn-blasted denunciations of the company and the Philadelphia police.

The anger stems from an incident Thursday afternoon, where two black men quietly waiting for a third business associate at the shop were asked to leave. They refused, and the store manager responded by calling the cops, who then arrested the men as the white man they were waiting for arrived. The whole incident was caught on tape by another patron, Melissa DePino, whose tweet of the video went viral.

For any kind of business, an incident like this is a PR nightmare. But it‚Äôs particularly devastating for a company like Starbucks, said Kate Allison, CEO of Karma Agency.

‚ÄúStarbucks has been from the very beginning a place where people go to gather ‚Äî you go there to read, to work on your laptop, to have conversations with people,‚Äù said Allison. ‚ÄúThat is a huge part of the brand; it‚Äôs a dimension that we‚Äôve all sort of universally accepted. And that makes this particular situation feel that much worse.‚Äù

In the wake the fiasco, Starbucks has scrambled to respond. The CEO, Kevin Johnson, flew to Philadelphia, promising to personally apologize to the two arrested men, and called their arrest ‚Äúreprehensible.‚Äù Starbucks initially refused to point blame at the unnamed manager, but has since then announced that she was leaving the store, in what Starbucks called a ‚Äúmutual decision.‚Äù Johnson has promised to implement new training for managers on unconscious bias.

According to Rebecca DeVine, a principal at Maven Communications, the company‚Äôs initial response was too slow and generic ‚Äî it failed to address the racial dynamic that made the incident so emotionally charged. But, since that initial stumble, Johnson has made all the right moves, said Devine.

‚ÄúI think what‚Äôs pretty admirable is that he‚Äôs decided to take full ownership of problem and assume full responsibility,‚Äù Devine said. ‚ÄúAnd not just saying this is one person‚Äôs problem, and that doesn‚Äôt represent us, but saying maybe we need to look at all policies and issues.‚Äù

If Starbucks simply pointed a finger at the manager, it could be accused of ignoring a systemic problem the next time one of its employees did something questionable. And with around 238,000 employees worldwide, that‚Äôs just a matter of time. Now, the company may be inoculated against complaints of disregarding inequitable treatment of customers based on their race.

That kind of upfront ownership of heated issues has also served the City of Philadelphia well, said Allison.

‚ÄúI think that Mayor Kenney has been extremely outspoken on his position around biases of any sort and he really has a zero tolerance level for any biases,‚Äù she said.

While companies seeking to relocate or expand to another city may avoid cities embroiled in heated social controversies, this incident shouldn‚Äôt negatively impact Philadelphia. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine this would reverberate to the point where it would affect the decision for companies to move to Philadelphia,‚Äù said Allison.

Ultimately, customers will decide whether Starbucks‚Äô response has been adequate. But investors are betting that it will be: As of Monday afternoon, the company‚Äôs stock price was in fine health ‚Äî down only a sliver from where it was before the arrests went viral."

An attorney for two black men who were arrested in a Philadelphia Starbucks has said that race clearly played a role in the incident, video of which sparked widespread outrage.

'I would love to hear the 911 call on this case,' criminal defense attorney Lauren Wimmer told NBC Nightly News on Sunday.

'Can you imagine the 911 call if it was ""There's two white women sitting here. One of them asked to used the bathroom and she didn't order anything, come quick!"",' she said.

Wimmer declined to identify the two men, who were arrested inside the Starbucks at 18th and Spruce on Thursday after refusing to leave when asked to by managers and police.

'Two young black men, who were simply waiting to be joined by a friend, were blatantly discriminated against based on their race. Not only is this inexcusable, it's illegal,' Wimmer said in a statement.

Meanwhile, protests broke out outside the store on Sunday with Black Lives Matter demonstrators calling for a boycott of the chain.

Carrying signs and shouting through bullhorns, the protesters entered the store and demanded the firing of the manager who called police.

Starbucks said late Sunday that the manager at the location in question no longer worked at the store.

Wimmer took on the case pro bono after hearing about it from the man the two black men claimed they were waiting to meet, real estate investor Andrew Yaffe, she told the Philadelphia Inquirer.

'What did they get called for, because there were two black guys sitting here meeting me?' Yaffe is seen asking cops on video of the incident.

Yaffe is reportedly a family friend of the men who were arrested, and was meeting them to discuss some kind of real estate transaction.

Video of the incident does not show what led up to the arrests, but police say they were called by the business and told that two men had come in and asked to use the restroom.

Employees told the two men that the bathroom was for paying customers, and asked them to buy something or leave, which the men refused to do, police said.

The men refused to leave three times additional times when asked to by police, Police Commissioner Richard Ross said.

Ross, who is black, defended the arrests in a video statement on Saturday.

Philadelphia's police commissioner Richard Ross (pictured) said police asked the men to leave three times but they refused, and they were then arrested but were later released

Ross said the officers 'did absolutely nothing wrong' and were professional in their conduct toward the individuals but 'got the opposite back.'

He did not mention Yaffe, the person who said he was meeting with the men.

'As an African American male, I am very aware of implicit bias; we are committed to fair and unbiased policing,' Ross said.

But he added: 'If a business calls and they say that 'Someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business' (officers) now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties and they did just that.'

'Starbucks said that according to the company policy they do not allow nonpaying members or nonpaying people to come in and use the restroom. And so they then asked these two males to leave. These two males refused to leave and the police were called,' he added.

He said that the officers on the scene called for a police supervisor to 'avoid the situation from getting out of hand', adding that it was a good decision.

The officers then asked the males on three different occasions 'politely to leave the location because they were asked to leave by employees because they were trespassing'.

The men refused to budge and even insulted the officers for being low-paid city employees, the commissioner said.

He stressed that the males were not harmed in the arrest and were taken to the police district.

Mayor Jim Kenney said he asked the city Commission on Human Relations to examine the company‚Äôs policies and procedures 'including the extent of, or need for, implicit bias training for its employees'

At the end of Ross' statement, he acknowledged the racial tension that is surrounding the incident.

'I will say that as an African American male I am very aware of implicit bias. We are committed to fair and unbiased policing and anything less than that will not be tolerated in this department,' he said.

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said he asked the city Commission on Human Relations to examine the company‚Äôs policies and procedures 'including the extent of, or need for, implicit bias training for its employees'.

'I know Starbucks is reviewing it and we will be too. @PhillyPolice is conducting an internal investigation,' he tweeted on Saturday.

Starbucks' CEO Kevin Johnson expressed his 'deepest apologies' about the incident and plans to fly to Philadelphia to help correct the situation.

'I hope to meet personally with the two men who were arrested to offer a face-to-face apology,' Johnson said Saturday.

'Regretfully, our practices and training led to a bad outcome - the basis for the call to the Philadelphia police department was wrong,' Johnson said in a statement.

'Our store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did,' he continued.

Social media users are calling for a boycott of Starbucks after a store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, called the cops on two black men who were waiting for their friend

One user claimed that people have to be 'this white' in order to sit at a table in Starbucks. The men were reportedly asked to leave but refused

One user said they wanted to hear the 911 call from the employee who asked for cops to come in and assist the matter

Social media users were outraged by the action of the officers and even encouraged people to boycott the popular coffee chain. On Saturday, the hashtag #BoycottStarbucks was trending on Twitter.

One user posted a photo of the milk in her coffee and said: 'At Starbucks you must be THIS white to sit at their tables'.

Other users called the altercation 'racism at its ugliest level' in America.

The two men were placed into handcuffs and escorted out of the video, which is shown in a viral video that has since garnered more than 3.2million views.

At first Starbucks released a statement on Friday saying: 'We're aware of the incident on Thursday in a Philadelphia store with 2 guests and law enforcement, resulting in their removal. We're reviewing the incident with our partners, law enforcement and customers to determine what took place and led to this unfortunate result.'

They issued a second statement Saturday.

'We apologize to the two individuals and our customers and are disappointed this led to an arrest. We take these matters seriously and clearly have more work to do when it comes to how we handle incidents in our stores. We are reviewing out policies and will continue to engage with the community and the police department to try to ensure these types of situations never happen in any of our stores,' the statement said.

Starbucks released a statement Saturday where it apologized to the two men. But one user thought the apology wasn't sufficient and decided to edit it themselves

Another user compared this incident to others that have occurred recently across the US. He mentioned the people who were mad about the teen who got into 20 colleges and the ex-firefighter who shot at a black teenager on his doorstep

But one Twitter user edited the statement to include that the moment was 'racial profiling' and 'racially motivated harassment'.

The two black men who were arrested in the coffee shop have since been released and remain unidentified.

A spokesman for the district attorney's office said the men were released 'because of lack of evidence' that a crime had been committed, the Associated Press reported."

Johnson was asked by ""Good Morning America"" if he thought Thursday's incident which resulted in the men's arrest was a case of ""racial profiling."" He did not directly answer that question, but he did say: ""Starbucks was built as a company that creates a warm, welcoming environment for all customers. That didn't happen here in this case.""

A statement signed by Johnson on Saturday night read, in part: ""First, to once again express our deepest apologies to the two men who were arrested with a goal of doing whatever we can to make things right. Second, to let you know of our plans to investigate the pertinent facts and make any necessary changes to our practices that would help prevent such an occurrence from ever happening again. And third, to reassure you that Starbucks stands firmly against discrimination or racial profiling.""

The woman who posted the video of the arrests that went viral said staff at the Starbucks called police because the two men had not ordered anything while waiting for a friend.

@Starbucks The police were called because these men hadn't ordered anything. They were waiting for a friend to show up, who did as they were taken out in handcuffs for doing nothing. All the other white ppl are wondering why it's never happened to us when we do the same thing.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross on Saturday defended the actions of his officers, saying they had no choice but to act after Starbucks employees told them the pair were trespassing.

Johnson on Monday refused to say what, if any, repercussions the Starbucks employees who called 911 might face.

""Clearly, there's an opportunity for us to provide clarity and in addition to that I'd say there's training, more training that we're going to do with our store managers, not only around the guidelines but training around unconscious bias,"" he said.

Johnson said he's made contact with representatives of the two men, who were later released with no charges, asking for a face-to-face meeting, so he can ""apologize in person"" and enlist them to talk about a ""constructive solution.""

About two dozen protesters on Monday morning took over the Philadelphia Starbucks where Thursday's arrests took place.

Johnson has been in the CEO role for little more than one year, getting the promotion after the company's longtime chief executive, Howard Schultz, stepped down to focus his efforts on trying to turn the Starbucks high-end Reserve Roastery-branded coffee bars into destination restaurants.

On Thursday, I was thrust, or rather, I inadvertently inserted myself into a national conversation about race. Me ‚Äì a middle-aged, upper-middle-class white woman who has never had to worry about where I go, what I do, or how I act. And now that I‚Äôm here, in this conversation, I have a few things to say.

Melissa DePino Andrea Cipriani Mecchi

Most importantly, none of this attention I‚Äôm getting for tweeting the video that showed the horrific treatment of two young black men in Philadelphia just doing what we all do at Starbucks ‚Äì sitting and talking quietly ‚Äì should be about me or any other person who does not experience these kinds of indignities, threats of violence and discrimination every day. Yes, I was the vehicle to spark a new chapter in the conversation, but it doesn‚Äôt matter how I feel or what I experienced. How did these two men feel as they were arrested? Why did this incident happen? What can we do to make sure that incidents like these ‚Äì and worse ‚Äì stop happening? These are the questions that matter.

When I posted the video, right after the young men were taken out of the cafe in handcuffs and as they were being put into a patrol car, I did it because it felt like the right thing to do in that moment. I didn‚Äôt expect it to go viral; in fact, I didn‚Äôt expect it to get much attention at all.

Things like this happen to black and brown people in this country every single day, and they talk about it, tweet about it, and write about it, but for more reasons than I can discuss intelligently in this small space, people who look like me ‚Äì white people ‚Äì often don‚Äôt see, hear or believe their stories. And what‚Äôs even worse is that it often takes a black or brown person experiencing this type of painful situation ‚Äì and having it exposed it to the world ‚Äì for many of us to even get involved, which in and of itself is part of the larger problem.

After my tweet went viral, a well-meaning friend of my generation, who believes herself to be racially unbiased, said to me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm shocked. I never knew that still happened until I saw your video.‚Äù My first thought in response was: Really? And my second was to wonder: What was it about this story that broke through to her when other stories didn‚Äôt?

Was it the fact that the video was taken by someone she trusted, someone who looks like her? Was it that she doesn‚Äôt enter the much-needed conversation on race because she‚Äôs afraid or uncomfortable? Is it because she thinks that it‚Äôs not a problem that today, in America in 2018, counts as her problem? These are also important questions, and I don‚Äôt have good answers.

I‚Äôm happy that posting the video allowed her to see the reality and believe it. What I‚Äôm not happy about is that it took exposing the trauma and shame that these young men experienced for her ‚Äì or me, for that matter ‚Äì to get involved. But now that she, and 10 million (and counting) other people have seen it, I hope that they will actually start listening ‚Äì not to me, but to the people who experience the painful and destructive effects of implicit bias. This bias may perhaps be an even more insidious version of racism than our parents‚Äô or grandparents‚Äô version ‚Äì if there‚Äôs actually even any way to compare, which there likely isn‚Äôt.

In a video posted to social media that has been viewed more than 8 million times, Philadelphia police officers can be seen arresting two black men Thursday inside the store at 18th and Spruce streets while other patrons ask 'What did they do wrong?'

In a follow-up tweet, Hart also questioned why the men were arrested.

""@Starbucks in Philadelphia I have watched the video and do not see these to [ sic ] young men doing anything wrong....Unless there is footage that shows otherwise you need to do what's right and handle the manager that was on duty accordingly,"" Hart tweeted.

Hart added that this is not a boycott of Starbucks.

""Let's make one thing very clear....This is not a boycott @Starbucks situation....This is horrible management. The manager on duty was wrong. It's that simple...That's who needs to take responsibility for this wrong doing,"" Hart tweeted.

Attorney Lauren Wimmer, who represents the two men, told Action News her clients were innocently waiting for a third person to conduct a business meeting. She said it was the manager at the Starbucks who called the police, and that her clients weren't doing anything wrong.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross said the department's internal investigation revealed the officers who responded to the scene acted appropriately, and in accordance with police guidelines.

Starbucks issued an apology on Saturday:

""We apologize to the two individuals and our customers and are disappointed this led to an arrest. We take these matters seriously and clearly have more work to do when it comes to how we handle incidents in our stores. We are reviewing our policies and will continue to engage with the community and the police department to try to ensure these types of situations never happen in any of our stores.""

Later that night, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson issued another apology, saying the company is investigating and will make any necessary changes to their practices. He also says he hopes to meet the two men personally to offer a face-to-face apology."

Starbucks manager who made call resulting in black men's arrests no longer works for company

The manager who called police on two black men who had refused to leave a Philadelphia Starbucks no longer works there, a company spokeswoman confirmed to ABC News today.

The news follows Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson‚Äôs comments this morning that he will order managers of the coffee giant's stores to undergo training on how to spot ""unconscious bias"" after witnesses said the men were arrested at a Philadelphia shop for doing nothing but sitting at a table.

""I'll say the circumstances surrounding the incident and the outcome at our store on Thursday were reprehensible,"" Johnson said in an exclusive interview with ABC News‚Äô ""Good Morning America"" today. ""They were wrong, and for that, I personally apologize to the gentlemen that visited our store.""

A Starbucks spokesman told The Inquirer and Daily News of Philadelphia that the manager left the downtown store at 18th and Spruce Streets in what the company called a ‚Äúmutual‚Äù decision.

Johnson, the chief executive officer, was in Philadelphia this morning, a day after protesters rallied Sunday at a downtown Philadelphia Starbucks, where the two black men, who have yet to be identified, were led out in handcuffs Thursday by police and accused of trespassing.

The demonstrators had demanded Starbucks fire the manager of the store for calling the police.

As Johnson was being interviewed on ‚ÄúGMA‚Äù this morning, about two dozen protesters were at the downtown Philadelphia Starbucks chanting, ""A whole lot of racism, a whole lot of crap, Starbucks coffee is anti-black.""

The protesters later held a sit-in inside the Starbucks shop.

""We don't want this Starbucks to make any money today. That's our goal,"" Abdul-Aliy Muhammad, one of the protest's organizers and co-founder of the Black and Brown Workers Collective, told The Associated Press.

In response, the company‚Äôs CEO said this morning, Starbucks will conduct a thorough investigation of the incident and he hopes to ask the two men who were arrested to ""join me in finding a constructive way to solve this issue.""

Johnson said he has yet to speak to the men, who have retained an attorney.

""Clearly, there's an opportunity for us to provide clarity and in addition to that I'd say there's training, more training that we're going to do with our store managers, not only around the guidelines but training around unconscious bias,"" Johnson said.

The 28,000 Starbucks store across the nation may have slightly different regional guidelines on how to handle situations that warrant police intervention, he added.

""Now, there are some scenarios where the police should be called. If there's threats or disturbance, those may be appropriate times,"" Johnson said. ""In this case, none of that occurred. It was completely inappropriate to engage the police.""

The arrests of the men were captured on video and tweeted by Melissa DePino, a 50-year-old mother of two who told ABC News she has vowed not to patronize Starbucks again. The video has since been viewed more than 9 million times.

""It was humiliating for those guys,"" DePino said. ""They were completely minding their own business.""

Both men were later released and the charges they were facing -- trespassing and disturbance -- were dropped Thursday night.

Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner also refused to prosecute after Starbucks asked to not press charges.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross Jr. said in a video testimonial released by the police department Saturday that his officers ""did absolutely nothing wrong.""

""I can tell you candidly these officers did a service they were called to do,"" he said.

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney slammed Starbucks for the incident, saying it ""appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018.""

Reggie Shuford, executive director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania, also condemned the incident, saying in a statement today that ""it shows that black people can't even 'wait while black.'""

""Starbucks failed these men and all of its customers by treating them in this unfair and demeaning way,"" Shuford said. ""Based on all eyewitness accounts, there was no need for police intervention. These men were terribly disrespected by Starbucks employees.""

Shuford also faulted the police for arresting the men, adding Ross needs to change his department's policies and procedures.

‚ÄúStarbucks may be able to decide who sits in its store, but only the police could decide to arrest these men,"" Shuford said.

Johnson, the CEO, said Starbucks accepts full responsibility for what occurred.

""Starbucks was built as a company that creates a warm, welcoming environment for all customers,"" he told ‚ÄúGMA.‚Äù

""That didn't happen in this case. That, I know. And so it's my responsibility to ensure that we review everything. We review the actions of the store manager, we review the guidelines that were provided and we review and invest in the training necessary to ensure that doesn't happen again."""

The ‚Äúracial-bias education‚Äù training is scheduled for May 29 for nearly 175,000 employees, the company said in a statement Tuesday.

The announcement follows days of protest and a personal apology by Starbucks chief executive Kevin Johnson to the men in a private meeting Monday, a company spokeswoman confirmed to The Washington Post. The spokeswoman, Jamie Riley, did not provide additional details.

‚ÄúClosing our stores for racial bias training is just one step in a journey that requires dedication from every level of our company and partnerships in our local communities,‚Äù Johnson said in the statement.

Starbucks said the curriculum will focus on how employees can recognize and address their own biases to prevent future discrimination.

Johnson, who rushed from Seattle to Philadelphia as the backlash erupted, also met with Philadelphia‚Äôs mayor and police commissioner.

The chief executive has publicly apologized for what he called ‚Äúreprehensible‚Äù circumstances that led to the arrest of the two men at a store in Philadelphia‚Äôs Center City district Thursday.

‚ÄúI will fix this,‚Äù Johnson said in a video message.

In an interview Monday on ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù Johnson said that ‚Äúwhat happened to those two gentlemen was wrong‚Äù and that the company was reviewing the actions of the store manager who had called police.

‚ÄúMy responsibility is to look not only to that individual but look more broadly at the circumstances that set that up just to ensure that never happens again,‚Äù Johnson said.

Starbucks said later that the manager who called police ‚Äúis no longer at that store.‚Äù

The Starbucks at the corner of 18th and Spruce had closed temporarily because of demonstrations inside and outside but reopened Tuesday morning to little commotion. No protesters were outside, and the customers in line showed little interest in talking about what had happened there in recent days. It was business as usual inside the store, with its neat displays of chicken BLT protein boxes and sparkling mimosa gourmet gummies.

A day earlier, demonstrators had convened at the location. One person in the crowd hoisted a sign that read, ‚ÄúIs she fired or nah?‚Äù ‚Äî a reference to the store manager who called police. Others chanted, ‚ÄúAnti-blackness anywhere is anti-blackness everywhere.‚Äù

On Tuesday, Philadelphia Police released the 911 call, as well as police dispatches and other transmission that provide a timeline of events.

At 4:37, a female employee at the Starbucks called the police to report ‚Äútwo gentlemen in my cafe that are refusing to make a purchase or leave.‚Äù Officers arrived at the Starbucks 4:41, according to the tape. At 4:44, officers requested backup and a supervisor for ‚Äúa group of males causing a disturbance‚Äù inside the Starbucks. Dispatch sent additional backup at 4:45.

At 5 p.m., the officers were en route to their headquarters with two arrests.

At least two cellphone videos captured the tense moment when at least six Philadelphia police officers stood over two seated black men, asking them to leave. One officer said that the men were not complying and were being arrested for trespassing.

‚ÄúWhy would they be asked to leave?‚Äù Andrew Yaffe asked on a video. Yaffe runs a real estate development firm and wanted to discuss business investment opportunities with the two men. ‚ÄúDoes anybody else think this is ridiculous?‚Äù he asked people nearby. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absolute discrimination.‚Äù

The two unidentified men were taken out in handcuffs soon after. They were held for nearly nine hours before being released, said criminal defense attorney Lauren Wimmer, who represented the men over the weekend when they potentially faced charges. No charges were filed, authorities said.

One of the videos of the arrest rocketed across social media, with more than 10 million views by Tuesday afternoon.

Benjamin Waxman, a spokesman for Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, said over the weekend that the office decided that there ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt sufficient evidence to charge [the men] with a crime.‚Äù

Johnson said Monday that there are scenarios that warrant a call to police ‚Äî including threats and other disturbances ‚Äî but that in this case, ‚Äúit was completely inappropriate to engage the police.‚Äù

The police were criticized for their handling of the situation. On Monday, the department referred to the police commissioner‚Äôs Facebook Live video from Saturday. Commissioner Richard Ross said in the video that one or both of the men asked to use the restroom but had not purchased anything. An employee said Starbucks company policy was to refuse the use of the restrooms to non-customers and asked the men to leave, according to Ross. The employee called the police when they refused.

‚ÄúThese officers did absolutely nothing wrong. They followed policy; they did what they were supposed to do. They were professional in all their dealings with these gentlemen,‚Äù Ross said in the video. ‚ÄúAnd instead, they got the opposite back.‚Äù Ross said police arrested the men after they refused three requests to leave.

Ross, who is black, said he was aware of issues of implicit bias ‚Äî unconscious discrimination based on race ‚Äî but did not say whether he believed it applied in this case. He said the incident underscores the need for more body-worn cameras to present different perspectives of police responses. The officers were not wearing cameras, he said.

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney met with Starbucks executives Monday and said they ‚Äúwere very contrite,‚Äù according to the Associated Press.

Kenney said in a statement that Starbucks ‚Äúwill cooperate fully with our probes of the matter, particularly the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations‚Äô review of Starbucks‚Äô policies. All parties agree that the outcome of this incident was extremely unfortunate and that‚Äôs why we are reviewing the incident seriously.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúThis is not just a Starbucks issue. This is a societal issue. People can react differently to others based on skin color, and that is wrong. We have work to do, and we need to do so productively.‚Äù

Starbucks does not have a companywide policy on asking members of the public to leave, a company official said. The company leaves safety and customer service protocol decisions up to store managers, said a company official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely describe internal discussions. Managers may leave restroom doors unlocked or add key-code entries if they feel the store is more at risk of criminal behavior. A store in the same area of Philadelphia was hit with an armed robbery recently, the official said.

The Starbucks official acknowledged that the incident is at odds with a common practice at Starbucks. The stores are ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù hubs, the official said, where people often drop in to use the WiFi or chat with friends without necessarily buying anything.

Rosalind Brewer, the company‚Äôs chief operating officer, called the incident a ‚Äúteachable moment for all of us,‚Äù in an interview with NPR Monday. She said that as an African American executive with a 23-year-old son, she found the cellphone videos taken of the Thursday afternoon arrest painful to watch.

‚ÄúIt would be easy for us to say that this was a one-employee situation, but I have to tell you, it‚Äôs time for us to, myself included, take personal responsibility here and do the best that we can to make sure we do everything we can,‚Äù Brewer said.

But to some black Philadelphia residents who venture into Rittenhouse Square, the neighborhood where it happened, the treatment depicted in the video was a frustrating reality of everyday life.

Christian Hayden, 30, recalled a security guard searching his bags as he left a nearby Barnes & Noble. The guard found his copy of Ta-Nehisi Coates‚Äôs memoir ‚ÄúThe Beautiful Struggle,‚Äù and would not let him leave until the staff had checked the shelves to make sure no copy had been stolen.

The scene of two black men in handcuffs being led out of the Philadelphia coffee shop by police last week delivered an uncomfortable reminder of the country‚Äôs racial disparities.

The incident illustrates a pervasive bias that can affect even the most mundane activities in U.S. public spaces ‚Äî in this case, meeting someone for a coffee. The two men were waiting for a business associate when the manager called the police.

Nowhere else in Philadelphia are African Americans more disproportionately stopped by police than in the Center City neighborhood surrounding the Starbucks, two blocks from ritzy Rittenhouse Square, where rents in luxury apartments run as high as $10,000 a month.

While African Americans make up 3 percent of the area‚Äôs residents, they account for 67 percent of pedestrian police stops, according to a 2017 analysis by the American Civil Liberties Union, which has monitored racial disparity in Philadelphia policing for eight years. Most of those stopped were never charged.

Similar racial disparities in citations and arrests for commercial trespassing occur across the country, according to lawyers and civic leaders.

In Grand Rapids, Mich., African Americans make up 21 percent of the population but accounted for 59 percent of commercial trespassing arrests at businesses such as gas stations and bars, according to the ACLU, which filed a federal lawsuit against the city in 2013.

In Washington, businesses in Georgetown operated a private messaging app that allowed retailers to alert police officers about people they considered suspicious. The vast majority of suspicions in the wealthy, predominantly white community were about black people, some of whom were described in offensive language. The service was suspended in 2015 after concerns arose about racial profiling.

‚ÄúIt raises all kinds of questions. How long can you be on a property? Can you not browse at these stores now? Who gets to determine whether you‚Äôre acting as a patron or as a trespasser?‚Äù said Jason D. Williamson, senior staff attorney with the ACLU‚Äôs Criminal Law Reform Project, referring to the disproportionate targeting of African Americans. ‚ÄúIt goes to the judgments that are made not only by the police but by store owners who ratchet up the level of suspicion depending on what you look like.‚Äù

For many African Americans, particularly young black men, the pervasive scrutiny means never letting down their guards while shopping, dining or gathering with friends, Williamson said.

This vigilance may translate into always asking for a receipt and shopping bag, even as municipalities impose small charges for plastic bags. Or dressing in a collared shirt simply to run weekend errands. Or being mindful not to linger for too long in a store.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the day-to-day opportunity costs of being black in America,‚Äù said Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, a nonprofit advocacy group.

Kevin Harden Jr., a 32-year-old lawyer who works near Rittenhouse Square, said he often is ignored by wait staff when he trades in his three-piece suits for jeans and Timberland boots on weekends.

‚ÄúThe employees frequently don‚Äôt have the ability to delineate between a homeless person and a black professional when I have on jeans,‚Äù Harden said. ‚ÄúThey lack cultural competency. It‚Äôs like an invisibility when I‚Äôm seeking service, but they see me when they dislike me.‚Äù

In the Starbucks case, one or both of the men had asked to use the restroom before they purchased anything. A Starbucks employee told the men that the company policy was to refuse the use of bathrooms to non-customers and asked the men to leave, according to an account by Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross.

The manager called the police when the men did not leave. Police handcuffed the men and led them out of the store, a scene captured by bystanders‚Äô cellphones. They were released early the next morning with no charges filed.

Starbucks chief executive Kevin Johnson apologized to the men in person this week for what he called the ‚Äúreprehensible‚Äù circumstances that led to their arrest. The company also removed the manager who called police.

Ross, who is black, has defended his police department‚Äôs handling of the case, describing the officers‚Äô response as ‚Äúprofessional.‚Äù

‚ÄúThese officers did absolutely nothing wrong. They followed policy; they did what they were supposed to do,‚Äù Ross said on Facebook Live on Saturday.

Craig M. Straw, Philadelphia‚Äôs first deputy city solicitor, said the city and police department have been working with the ACLU to cut in half the number of pedestrian stops without reasonable suspicion since 2016.

Officers who have consistently high numbers of inappropriate stops are disciplined, from verbal counseling to suspension.

Advertisement

Straw acknowledged that despite the reduced number of stops, the racial disparities remain. He said experts who have examined the data disagree on whether race played a predominant role in the stops.

Jeannine Deni, store manager at a Barnes & Noble in Center City, said people are welcome to read in the bookstore or sit in its second-floor cafe for as long as they would like without making a purchase. Restrooms are also open to the public.

She said the store rarely involves the police, doing so only when visitors are harming themselves or others.

Deni said it is important that people in the community know the store is a safe place.

‚ÄúIt all comes down to behavior,‚Äù Deni said. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre sitting and reading a book, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôd expect to see in a bookstore.‚Äù

At a McDonald‚Äôs near Rittenhouse Square, a sign alerts customers to the store‚Äôs 20-minute time limit for consuming food. ‚ÄúPLEASE ‚Äî NO LOITERING,‚Äù the sign said in bold, capital black letters.

Latasha Adams, a manager at the restaurant, defended the restaurant‚Äôs policies on loitering and trespassing. Almost once a day, Adams says, employees have to escort an unruly visitor or patron out of the store.

Adams said the time limit is necessary even for paying customers who keep to themselves, to prevent them from ‚Äútaking advantage of the situation.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe customer doesn‚Äôt like it when people trespass,‚Äù Adams said. ‚ÄúIt kind of hurts our business because who wants to eat here when you have a trespasser just chilling in here, just taking up spaces that are supposed to be for the customers?‚Äù

But Mary Catherine Roper, deputy legal director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania, said some business owners use law enforcement to ‚Äúfrighten away people they don‚Äôt want there.‚Äù

Share this article Share

‚ÄúBusinesses call police all the time to keep people who they don‚Äôt like the looks of from congregating in front of their store,‚Äù Roper said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs homeless people, not only African Americans.‚Äù

The ACLU of Pennsylvania filed a 2010 lawsuit against the Philadelphia Police Department for racial profiling, although Roper said the force had improved its practices in recent years and no longer stops people solely for ‚Äúloitering.‚Äù

Local teenagers Gabriel Bangert, 15, and Steven Gregory, 15, said it was only a matter of time before a racial-profiling incident in Center City garnered national attention.

Bangert, who identifies as white, black and Puerto Rican, said he‚Äôs witnessed police ask black men playing Frisbee in Rittenhouse Square to leave for ‚Äútalking loudly.‚Äù

Gregory, who is Guatemalan, said that two months ago an African American classmate was asked to leave the Starbucks, which is near their school, after not buying anything.

While the recent arrests have drawn national outrage, Gregory said the mistreatment of black customers is hardly isolated to that one store or chain ‚Äî or indeed to Philadelphia.

‚ÄúIt happens a lot,‚Äù he said.

In Grand Rapids, the 2013 lawsuit stemmed from the police department‚Äôs longtime practice of relying on ‚Äúno-trespass letters‚Äù signed by business owners to deter crime. Police used the program to justify stopping, questioning and sometimes searching individuals who they deemed did not have a legitimate business purpose to be on the property ‚Äî even without speaking with the business owner or any employee about the person. Police considered the program a valuable law enforcement tool designed to combat low-level crime.

‚ÄúThe fact that a store had a no-trespass letter in the window cannot be enough to give police the authority to stop someone,‚Äù Williamson said.

The city changed its policy in 2017 to prohibit police from using no-trespass letters as the sole basis for a pedestrian stop.

Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, said that until U.S. society addresses the issue of implicit bias, the disproportionate wrongful arrests of African Americans will continue.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an ever-present threat to one‚Äôs freedom,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúOur ability to express ourselves freely is drastically hampered by the fact that someone could interpret malicious motives just because we exist or appear a certain way.‚Äù"

In the 4:37 p.m. ET 911 call from last Thursday, a Starbucks employee, believed to be the manager, asks police to come to the store.

""I have two gentlemen in my cafe that are refusing to make a purchase or leave. I am at the Starbucks at 18th and Spruce,"" the employee said.

That call set events in motion that would lead to series of apologies by Starbucks, saying it should never have been placed; an afternoon of racial bias training at almost 8,000 stores scheduled for next month and angry protestors descending on the store amid calls for a boycott.

At the Starbucks store that afternoon, the two men explained they were waiting for a friend. One had asked for access to a restroom and was denied because he hadn't bought anything. The manager then called police even though Starbucks, with its comfy chairs and usually ample electric outlets for computers, has never shunned being a community meeting spot.

The incident raised issues of whether Starbucks has a double standard because of the belief that white men or women wouldn't have been asked to leave if they hadn't ordered food or drink.

In the recording, a police car is dispatched. Officers ask for backup and a supervisor due to a ""disturbance at the Starbucks"" involving a ""group of males."" Officers then indicate they are going to make arrests and transport the pair.

When the officers arrived, a patron videotaped the incident. The tape shows the pair's friend, who is white, arriving and questioning why the arrests are taking place. The two men remain calm as they are handcuffed and led away.

Starbucks didn't press trespassing charges. The pair were later released."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/04/17/what-white-people-can-learn-from-the-starbucks-arrests/,Opinion | What white people can learn from the Starbucks arrests,17/04/2018,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"Last week, two black men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks. According to media interviews from those who were there, the men were there to meet a friend. At some point, the two men were denied the use of the store‚Äôs bathroom and then asked to leave. When they refused, an employee called the police. They were arrested on suspicion of trespassing and detained for eight hours before they were released without charges. Cellphone video of the arrests went viral, sparking protests and both a personal apology and a promise from Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson to train employees for ‚Äúunconscious bias.‚Äù

By all accounts, the two men did nothing to provoke their arrests, other than remain at a Starbucks after being asked to leave. It also isn‚Äôt clear why they were asked to leave. Starbucks of course isn‚Äôt obligated to provide space in its store for non-customers, but it isn‚Äôt as if this is a policy that the chain strictly enforces. The two men certainly seem to have been singled out because of their race.

Reaction to the story has been pretty universally condemnatory of both the Starbucks staff and the Philadelphia police officers who made the arrest. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross (who, given the subject matter, it‚Äôs worth noting is black) has been one of the few to publicly defend the officers. In a statement on Facebook Live, Ross said the police ‚Äúdid absolutely nothing wrong,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúThey did a service that they were called to do. And if you think about it logically, that if a business calls and they say that someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business, [officers] now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties. And they did just that.‚Äù

But of course not everyone accused of trespassing gets arrested. Police officers have discretion in how to resolve disputes such as this. Here, it‚Äôs relatively ambiguous what does and does not constitute trespassing. Yes, the men were asked to leave. But they were asked to leave a public facility open to everyone else but them, and for reasons that smacked to them of bias. It isn‚Äôt as if they climbed a fence and ignored ‚ÄúNo Trespassing‚Äù signs. At the end of the day, if two men can be arrested and detained for eight hours for refusing a barista‚Äôs order to leave, then there‚Äôs something wrong with the policy. The near-universal outrage over the incident is also a good indication that the policy needs to change.

After an initial milquetoast apology, Starbucks executives have been much more contrite. The company announced it would close more than 8,000 stores on May 29 for ‚Äúracial-bias education. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said he was ‚Äúheartbroken‚Äù over the arrests but put the blame more on Starbucks than on city police.

That this incident could generate so much outrage and national attention is encouraging. Too often when an incident like this happens, you see the usual breakdown along ideological lines ‚Äî white conservatives back the police, while most people of color and left-leaning white people support those whom the police are accused of harassing, beating or shooting. This one seems to have inspired pan-partisan condemnation.

But before we get too self-congratulatory about our wokeness, imagine that these two black men came forward to say they had been wrongly arrested, but there was no video and no white people in the Starbucks corroborated their story. My guess is that a good percentage of white people would assume they had done something to provoke the cops. They were probably too loud. Maybe they were harassing other customers. Perhaps they tried to take something without paying. Much of white America just isn‚Äôt ready to believe that black people can get arrested, harassed by cops or beaten for doing little to nothing.

A couple of years ago, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a conservative Republican, took to the floor of the U.S. Senate to describe the harassment he and some of his staff had received from police simply for being black men who drove nice cars. Some white conservatives took notice. Tim Scott is no Al Sharpton; no one could accuse him of benefiting from racial grievance. But of course Scott can‚Äôt be the only black person telling the truth about bad interactions with cops.

It‚Äôs true that the problems with policing ‚Äî and more broadly with our criminal-justice system ‚Äî aren‚Äôt inflicted exclusively on black and Latino people. White people are sometimes victimized, too. But one thing I‚Äôve noticed in covering policing issues for the past 10 years or so is that nearly every person of a color has a story about a bad interaction with police. They were stopped, then thoroughly and embarrassingly searched on the side of the road. A cop mistook something they were holding for a gun. They were wrongly arrested. They were roughed up. A traffic stop suddenly turned very scary. If it didn‚Äôt happen to them, it happened to a brother, a father or a close friend.

There‚Äôs a faction of white people who are legitimately concerned about some of these issues but who want to ignore the racial component of them. These white people will sometimes ask why no one was marching in the streets after the police shooting deaths of Daniel Shaver or Justine Damond, or legitimately ask why it‚Äôs considered bad form to say ‚ÄúAll Lives Matter‚Äù instead of that ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter.‚Äù When I‚Äôve interviewed the families and friends of white people killed by police, there can sometimes be an understandable feeling of isolation. Black Lives Matter is there for the black victims; who is marching for the white victims?

The difference, again, is that many white people tend to think that for a cop to shoot you, or beat you, or arrest you, you must have provoked them in some way. Don‚Äôt want police attention? Don‚Äôt commit crimes. Don‚Äôt hang with the wrong crowd or project an aura of violence and intimidation. Be polite and courteous when interacting with police. Do what you‚Äôre told, and you‚Äôll be fine. At worst, the most egregious police shootings of white people may be tragic, but they‚Äôre rare. They‚Äôre anomalies. We can‚Äôt empathize with the person who was shot because we can‚Äôt imagine a scenario in which a cop might consider us potentially dangerous. And that‚Äôs because we just don‚Äôt do the sorts of things that cause cops to shoot people.

When many black or Latino or, in some parts of the country, Native American people read about a police shooting of someone like them, the reaction is often more ‚ÄúThat could have been me. ‚ÄúThere are no precautions to take. It isn‚Äôt about not hanging with the wrong crowd, or not talking back to cops, or not engaging in criminal behavior. The ‚Äúsorts of things‚Äù they do that attract police attention are things such as being a U.S. senator driving a nice car, standing outside of a store, walking home after a long shift at a restaurant, trying to make a living by selling CDs, or waiting for a business associate at a Starbucks. It is simply to exist.

Sometimes the viral video doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story. Sometimes it tells us all we need to know. But we shouldn‚Äôt need a viral video and the word of white witnesses to understand that being black or brown often means negotiating an entirely different landscape when it comes to the police (as well as the white people who tend to call the police after seeing black people behave in a way that‚Äôs even the slightest bit abnormal).

https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/04/how-raced-spaces-explain-the-philadelphia-starbucks-arrests.html,The arrest of two men at a Philadelphia Starbucks shows how deeply raced our public spaces can be.,17/04/2018,https://slate.com,"Philadelphia is a city in which 43 percent of residents are black. The Philadelphia Starbucks where two black men were arrested last Thursday, however, is located in a zip code that is 79 percent white and just 6 percent black. In all likelihood, most of the clientele there is white, which, to borrow from sociologist Elijah Anderson, makes this particular location a ‚Äúwhite space,‚Äù or an area whose ‚Äúmost visible and distinctive feature is [the] overwhelming presence of white people and [the] absence of black people.‚Äù

This may explain why a Starbucks staff member called the police while the two men were waiting on a business associate. The employee says the men were trespassing and refused to leave the restaurant. Video of the incident‚Äîtaken by a bystander‚Äîshows them standing like any potential customers. That same footage shows their business associate arrive as they are arrested. He is white.

Race is about power and hierarchy. When one is ‚Äúraced,‚Äù one is placed in relationship to that hierarchy‚Äîyour position assigned to your body and made visible to the world. Places, too, can be raced. Spaces of affluence and exclusivity are typically associated with white faces, reflecting racial distributions of wealth and power. Films like Get Out take that association as a given, a conceit the filmmaker doesn‚Äôt even have to explain to the audience. There are ‚Äúblack spaces,‚Äù too. In a paper titled ‚ÄúThe Iconic Ghetto,‚Äù Anderson details the tight association between public housing projects and the black poor, a connection so strong that it‚Äôs become part of the overall racial stigma against blacks‚Äîa singular black pathology that supposedly explains the material conditions of those projects. Blacks, in this view, come from the ghetto and they carry the ghetto with them, representing its putative danger, crime, and poverty.

To many white Americans, this marks blacks as an inherent threat to the order and safety of their spaces. As Anderson writes, ‚ÄúWhen the anonymous black person enters the white space, others there immediately try to make sense of him or her‚Äîto figure out ‚Äòwho that is,‚Äô or to gain a sense of the nature of the person‚Äôs business and whether they need to be concerned.‚Äù

In these situations, black Americans face heightened scrutiny. This might mean racial profiling, as when shoppers are followed and questioned in retail stores. In 2013, according to the Pew Research Center, 44 percent of black Americans reported such treatment. It might mean unjustified contact with law enforcement. In Pulled Over: How Police Stops Define Race and Citizenship, authors Charles Epp, Steven Maynard-Moody, and Donald Haider-Markel find that suburban and exurban police are much more likely to stop black drivers for intrusive stops; white drivers are rarely stopped for such purposes.

Or it may mean violence. In mid-century Detroit, white mobs attacked and occasionally torched the homes of black people who moved in‚Äîor even near‚Äîall-white enclaves. In 1986, 23-year-old Michael Griffith died while fleeing a group of white men wielding baseball bats. His offense? Walking through Howard Beach, a largely white neighborhood of Queens, New York. And just last week, 14-year-old Brennan Walker was shot at after knocking on a door in the predominantly white Rochester Hills, Michigan. He was walking to school and had stopped to ask for directions.

Nothing so dire happened for the men of the Philadelphia Starbucks. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross, who is also black, says the officers who arrested the two men behaved appropriately. ‚ÄúThe police did not just happen upon this event‚Äîthey did not just walk into Starbucks to get a coffee,‚Äù he said in a video posted to Facebook. ‚ÄúThey were called there, for a service, and that service had to do with quelling a disturbance, a disturbance that had to do with trespassing. These officers did absolutely nothing wrong.‚Äù

The commissioner isn‚Äôt wrong about the scope of police authority in this situation. Once called to Starbucks, officers had every right to make an arrest and remove the men from the property. They were released from custody, and company CEO Kevin Johnson issued an apology. The police are conducting an internal investigation of the arrests. What‚Äôs critical is that this isn‚Äôt an isolated occurrence. Black Americans across class, gender, and other social lines have similar stories of hostile examination, or worse, when they find themselves in a ‚Äúwhite space.‚Äù

Everyone, eventually, finds themselves out of place. But it‚Äôs only some people‚Äîraced people‚Äîwho have to move with particular care through unfamiliar spaces, lest they bring ruinous scrutiny on themselves. And too often, even that caution is not enough."
https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/17/health/implicit-bias-philadelphia-starbucks/index.html,What the Starbucks incident tells us about implicit bias,17/04/2018,https://www.cnn.com,"CNN ‚Äî

Could implicit bias training prevent an incident like the one at a Philadelphia Starbucks in which two black men were arrested after asking to use the restroom?

The word ‚Äúimplicit bias‚Äù or some variation of it has been used by Starbuck‚Äôs CEO, the city‚Äôs police commissioner, its mayor, NAACP and outraged community members after the two were escorted from the coffee shop in handcuffs.

On Thursday, two men had asked to use the restroom at Starbucks, but were told that the bathrooms are for customers only. They occupied a table without making a purchase and a manager called the police after the men declined to leave the premises because, they said they were waiting for an acquaintance. They were escorted out by police, but were not charged with a crime. A manager who called the police, is no longer working at the store, Starbucks said Monday.

Starbucks‚Äô CEO Kevin Johnson has called for changes to its policy including ‚Äútraining around unconscious bias.‚Äù Jim Kenney, Philadelphia‚Äôs mayor also suggested that implicit bias training may be necessary for Starbuck‚Äôs employees.

What is implicit bias?

Implicit bias is the automatic associations people have in their minds about groups of people, including stereotypes. It forms automatically and unintentionally, but results in attitudes, behaviors or actions that are prejudiced for or against a person or a group of people.

‚ÄúThe nature of implicit bias is such that you cannot subjectively experience when it‚Äôs influencing you,‚Äù said Jack Glaser, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley.

In policing, implicit bias causes some groups to receive undeserved suspicion while other groups are presumed innocent, according to the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, a project that was funded by the Department of Justice in 2014.

And studies have shown that implicit bias contributes to ‚Äúshooter bias,‚Äù which is ‚Äúthe tendency for police to shoot unarmed black suspects more often than white ones ‚Äì as well as the frequency of police stops for members of minority groups,‚Äù according to the group.

Implicit bias can be insidious with deadly consequences, the NAACP said, listing recent examples of the police shooting of Stephon Clark and Saheed Vassell.

‚ÄúThe Starbucks situation provides dangerous insight regarding the failure of our nation to take implicit bias seriously,‚Äù said the group‚Äôs president and CEO Derrick Johnson in a statement. ‚ÄúWe refuse to believe that our unconscious bias ‚Äìthe racism we are often unaware of‚Äîcan and does make its way into our actions and policies.‚Äù

Implicit bias is universal, so it‚Äôs not only about the biases of officers, but those of the people calling police, Glaser said.

‚ÄúPolice officers are not the only one deciding who get subjected to policing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd so when people are calling in with a complaint, that‚Äôs influenced by their racial bias ‚Äì the stereotype that causes them to regard a black person with greater suspicion.‚Äù

Take a test from Project Implicit

Unconscious or implicit bias training

In the aftermath of the Starbucks incident, city leaders are demanding Starbucks engage in diversity and inclusion training and sensitivity training for all workers.

Anger has also been directed at the Philadelphia police officers for arresting the two men.

The city‚Äôs police commissioner Richard Ross said Saturday that its commanders receive implicit bias training. Also, all new police recruits visit the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, because ‚Äúwe want them to know about the atrocities that were in fact, committed by policing around the world,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúAs an African-American man, I am very aware of implicit bias,‚Äù he said in a Facebook video posted Saturday. ‚ÄúWe are committed to fair and unbiased policing. Anything less than that will not be tolerated in this department.‚Äù

Law enforcement agencies and companies have adopted bias training, but programs can vary.

Glaser, whose primary research interest is in stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination, says he hasn‚Äôt seen evidence to suggest that implicit bias training reduces discriminatory behavior in police departments and other institutions.

After training, some people say they‚Äôll try harder, and it‚Äôs also possible that they could use strategies and be more vigilant about overriding their biases.

‚ÄúBut when they‚Äôre busy doing their job, they‚Äôre distracted. The biases are still going to be operative and influence them unless you change the practices and the policies,‚Äù Glaser said.

‚ÄúThe bottom line is we don‚Äôt know how to change the biases in a meaningful, lasting way, because they‚Äôre ‚Ä¶the way we think normally and they‚Äôre based on years of exposure. So in the absence of being able to change them, we need to change the way people make decisions and the way that they act.‚Äù

This could involve changing general practices ‚Äì such as how ending New York‚Äôs stop-and-frisk policy reduced the number of minorities subjected to unnecessary stops, he said. Glaser suggested that Starbucks could employ prescriptive rules on how to handle someone believed to be loitering, with clear rules what to do in those circumstances when there‚Äôs no danger.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more a matter of changing the general practices, so that it‚Äôs less likely to happen in the first place,‚Äù he said."

PHILADELPHIA -- The chief executive officer of Starbucks says he will order managers of the coffee giant's stores to undergo training on how to spot ""unconscious bias"" after two black men were arrested at a Philadelphia shop for doing nothing but sitting at a table.

""I'll say the circumstances surrounding the incident and the outcome at our store on Thursday were reprehensible,"" Starbucks' CEO Kevin Johnson said in an exclusive interview with ABC News' ""Good Morning America"" Monday. ""They were wrong, and for that, I personally apologize to the gentlemen that visited our store.""

Meantime, a Starbucks spokeswoman confirms that the manager at the Starbucks at 18th and Spruce Streets who called police is no longer an employee at the store.

RELATED: Philadelphia Starbucks arrests: What a witness says happened

Johnson was in Philadelphia Monday morning, a day after protesters rallied Sunday at the downtown Philadelphia Starbucks where the two black men, who have yet to be identified, were led out in handcuffs by police and accused of trespassing.

The demonstrators demanded Starbucks fire the manager of the store for calling the police.

As Johnson was being interviewed on ""GMA,"" about two dozen protesters were at the downtown Philadelphia Starbucks chanting, ""A whole lot of racism, a whole lot of crap, Starbucks coffee is anti-black.""

""We don't want this Starbucks to make any money today, that's our goal,"" said Abdul-Aliy Muhammad, one of the protest's organizers and co-founder of the Black and Brown Workers Collective.

In response, the company's CEO said Starbucks will conduct a thorough investigation of the incident and hopes to ask the two men who were arrested to ""join me in finding a constructive way to solve this issue.""

Johnson said he has yet to speak to the men, who have retained an attorney.

""Clearly, there's an opportunity for us to provide clarity,"" Johnson said. ""And in addition to that, I'd say there's training, more training that we're going to do with our store managers, not only around the guidelines but training around unconscious bias.""

He added the 28,000 Starbucks store across the nation may have slightly different regional guidelines on how to handle situations that warrant police intervention.

""There are some scenarios where the police should be called,"" Johnson said. ""If there's threats or disturbance, those may be appropriate times. In this case, none of that occurred. It was completely inappropriate to engage the police.""

The arrests of the men were captured on video and tweeted by Melissa DePino, a 50-year-old mother of two who told ABC News she's vowed not to patronize Starbucks again. The video has since been viewed millions of times.

""It was humiliating for those guys,"" DePino said. ""They were completely minding their own business.""

Both men were later released, and the charges they were facing -- trespassing and disturbance -- were dropped Thursday night.

Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner also refused to prosecute after Starbucks asked to not press charges.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross Jr. said in a video testimonial released by the police department Saturday that his officers ""did absolutely nothing wrong.""

""I can tell you candidly these officers did a service they were called to do,"" he said.

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney slammed Starbucks for the incident, saying it ""appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018.""

Johnson said Starbucks accepts full responsibility for what occurred.

""Starbucks was built as a company that creates a warm, welcoming environment for all customers,"" he said. ""That didn't happen in this case. That, I know. And so it's my responsibility to ensure that we review everything. We review the actions of the store manager, we review the guidelines that were provided and we review and invest in the training necessary to ensure that doesn't happen again."""

The 911 call that brought police to a Starbucks in Philadelphia, resulting in the arrest of two African-American customers, lasted only seconds.

‚ÄúHi, I have two gentlemen at my caf√© that are refusing to make a purchase or leave. I‚Äôm at the Starbucks at 18th and Spruce,‚Äù a Starbucks employee told police last Thursday shortly after 4:30 p.m.

The brief 911 call was among recordings released Tuesday by the Philadelphia Police. Authorities also released dispatch and officer communications.

The men had initially asked to use the restroom inside the Starbucks but were told the cafe‚Äôs bathrooms were for customers only. They then sat at a table without making a purchase, which many observers have noted is a common occurrence at the franchise‚Äôs locations.

A manager called police after the men declined to leave the premises because, they said, they were waiting for an acquaintance.

The men were arrested for trespassing but no charges were filed.

The incident led to protests at the Rittenhouse Square location, including one that briefly shut the location down, and criticism of the mammoth coffee chain. Some protestors called Starbucks ‚Äúanti-black.‚Äù

Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson met with the two men on Monday and apologized for how they were treated, a company spokesperson said.

The manager who called the police is no longer working at that store, the company said.

Starbucks would not comment on other reports that she has left the company by mutual agreement.

On Tuesday, Starbucks said it will close its 8,000 company-owned stores in the United States for one afternoon to educate employees about racial bias."

On Point guest host Melissa Block talked with Ernest Owens, columnist and LGBTQ Editor at Philadelphia Magazine; DeRay Mckesson, organizer and activist, co-founder of Campaign Zero, and host of the podcast Pod Save the People; Rochelle Riley, columnist for the Detroit Free Press, author of The Burden: African Americans And The Enduring Impact Of Slavery; and Kimberly Adams, anchor and reporter with KYW Newsradio. The highlights below have been lightly edited for clarity.

(Note: after this show aired, Starbucks announced that it would close more than 8,000 of its U.S. stores on May 29 to conduct racial-bias training for its employees.)

Highlights:

On how the events transpired:

Adams: ""[After the arrests] immediately, there were some protests. Facebook is what lit up after that. It went viral. As a result of that, that's when police commissioner Richard Ross responded, and he stood by the officers, stood by what happened. He said, this is the Starbucks policy that you must pay if you're going to ask to use the bathroom... and that sparked even more outrage... On Sunday, there was a movement with protesters of all ages, races, and Black Lives Matter. It was a calm protest ---outraged, obviously. There was a lot of emotion, but it was calm. And then the crowd started growing.""

On black trauma porn:

Owens: ""The term has been used over the past several years by many academics, scholars, and commentators on basically the daily ongoing filming of black people being tortured or harassed or assaulted or killed in the hands of law enforcement. And we have continually seen these videos, whether it's Eric Garner, whether it was Stephon Clark, whether it is now this incident at Starbucks where we're often seeing black people experiencing trauma in a way that is very visceral, and in many ways can be numbing for especially people of color who often times have to go through the process of seeing these daily onslaughts happening.""

Block: ""I'm curious about that, because couldn't you also say that though, that without those videos, these incidents ‚Äî no one would know about them? They would not be made public and the outrage and potentially the change that happens would never happen.""

Owens: ""I'm cynical about that. I think that it's really sad that we have to continue to show these types of traumatic videos without people believing black people. It's really about believing people. I think it's inherently racist ‚Äî the assertion that people make ‚Äî when they believe that in order for us to believe the experiences that black people face, even though there [are] decades and centuries of history that can back these things up ‚Äî we have to see it.""

On police, discrimination, and Starbucks leadership:

Mckesson: ""This is about two black men having the police called on them literally only because they were black, not because of anything else. I think that apology number two is a recognition on Starbucks' behalf, that there's a culture piece. So hopefully this training does better work. There is a question though: who are you hiring and what are those values and beliefs that people are bringing into the workplace?""

""The police response every single time is: 'we were just following policy, the law is on our side.' That actually is true right now, and that in and of itself is the problem.""

""They'll make a hashtag, they'll make a post. But then they will continue on with their day, and continue to do work that goes against the larger message."" Ernest Owens, on performative activism

On ""performative activism"":

Owens: ""We see this consistent complicity, where it's that instant gratification, they want the instant reaction... mostly white people who often times do performative activism, they'll make a hashtag, they'll make a post. But then they will continue on with their day, and continue to do work that goes against the larger message.""

On the larger questions raised by recent events:

Owens: ""It seems like what we're noticing is that white people in these scenarios really take advantage of the most excessive uses of force ‚Äî whether it's the gun or law authority ‚Äî to respond to the most innocent actions of black people. And that's what the argument's about, that we can't get our humanity.""

Block: ""It does seem to me that one common denominator here is the real question: 'do you belong here?' Is that what underpins what we're seeing here?""

Riley: ""That is the question. In my book, 'The Burden,' we write extensively about how we have spent as African Americans in this country more than a century and a half seeking permission to be treated equally. To [be] accepted as first-class citizens. To experience humanity and freedom. And unfortunately, every single instance where you have someone who either wants to treat us like animals or treats us with fear ‚Äî it's always, as Ernest said, an overreaction.

CEO Kevin Johnson appeared on ABC‚Äôs Good Morning America on Monday, apologizing for the ‚Äúreprehensible‚Äù incident and saying that store managers will undergo unconscious bias training in order ‚Äúto ensure that doesn‚Äôt happen again.‚Äù

Johnson met with the two men face-to-face on Monday in Philadelphia, according to NBC. ‚ÄúI would like the opportunity to apologize to them face to face and I‚Äôd like to have a dialogue with them and the opportunity to listen to them with compassion and empathy,‚Äù Johnson said in an interview with the Associated Press earlier on Monday, adding, ‚Äúand finally I‚Äôd like to invite them to be part of helping me in a constructive way to ensure this never happens again.‚Äù Starbucks confirmed the meeting occurred but did not provide any details on what was discussed.

Johnson said he had watched video footage of the arrest that was posted by a Starbucks customer to social media, and called it ‚Äúvery hard to watch.‚Äù The two men were waiting on a friend to arrive and had not yet ordered anything; after the manager called the police, they were arrested for trespassing. Per NBC, the men remained in police custody for around eight hours until they were released with no charges.

Protestors have demanded that the store manager who called the police be fired, but Starbucks has yet to comment on whether or not they‚Äôve let the employee go. A company spokesperson did say that the employee no longer works at that particular store.

The announcement comes in response to public protests and calls to boycott the coffee chain after the arrest of two black men at a Philadelphia store last week. The store manager called 911 when the men refused to leave after trying to use the store's restroom without making a purchase.

""CBS This Morning"" co-host Gayle King sat down with Starbucks' executive chairman Howard Schultz to discuss how the company is handling the incident.

""I'm embarrassed, ashamed. I think what occurred was reprehensible at every single level. I think I take it very personally as everyone in our company does and we're committed to making it right. The announcement we made yesterday about closing our stores, 8,000 stores closed, to do significant training with our people is just the beginning of what we will do to transform the way we do business and educate our people on unconscious bias,"" Schultz said.

""It will cost millions of dollars, but I've always viewed this and things like this as not an expense, but an investment in our people and our company. And we're better than this,"" he said of the company's plan to close on May 29.

According to Schultz, the Philadelphia store manager who called the police has left the company. However, he said she is ""interested"" in sitting down with the two men who were arrested -- something Schultz sees as a ""unique opportunity"" for ""reconciliation.""

""Perhaps something good can come out of this and by that I mean, this has highlighted for us that we have more work to do as a company and I think, you know, race is a very difficult subject to discuss,"" he said.

The former Starbucks CEO admitted that it's possible that what unfolded in Philadelphia is not an ""isolated"" incident and said a complete review of their policies is in the works. Would the police have been called if the customers were white? He doesn't think so.

""There's no doubt in my mind that the reason that they (police) were called was because they were African American,"" he said. ""That's not who Starbucks is.""

According to Schultz, Starbucks has called in people including Sherrilyn Ifill from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and Bryan Stevenson of the Equal Justice Initiative to help guide the company in its efforts to reduce unconscious bias. Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson met with the men who were arrested to ask what the company can do for them. Schultz said that there's a possibility the two men could end up working with the company.

""What can Starbucks, given our resources, and the capabilities we have -- they have an interest in real estate -- what can we do to help advise them and support their own business endeavors,"" he said. ""We will provide them with a foundation of learning and provide them with an opportunity to be part of our company either directly or indirectly as a result of this situation."""

The answer is there are a few acceptable reasons, but legally they had better be consistent and within store policy ‚Äî and race is never one of them.

The question has come up amid a national uproar stemming from the videotaped arrest of two black men at a Starbucks in Philadelphia.

The men were denied use of a restroom because they didn't order food or drinks. The store manager called police when they refused to leave, explaining they were waiting for a friend. As video rolled, the friend arrived as police led the pair away in handcuffs. They were later released when Starbucks didn't press charges.

In the video, they are neatly groomed, wearing casual clothes and not causing a ruckus.

""If somebody is being disruptive or occupying very limited space . . . people would understand asking somebody to leave the premises,'' says Reginald Shuford, executive director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania. ""But even so, there‚Äôs only a certain amount of leeway they have in doing that.""

Starbucks said Tuesday that it will close its more than 8,000 company-owned stores in the U.S., as well as its corporate offices on the afternoon of May 29 to conduct anti-discrimination training. The company's CEO apologized and had discussions with the two men who were arrested. The manager who called the police no longer works for the chain.

Someone who is ""yelling and disrupting the environment . . . or damaging the property"" could likely generally be asked to leave a store or restaurant, says Robert Dodge, an executive vice president with G4S Corporate Risk Services, a global risk consulting group. But specific policies for what constitutes unacceptable behavior can vary by business.

Dodge says that most companies will consult with an attorney to come up with guidelines. Starbucks said it is reviewing its policies but has not made them public. Once those policies are established, security professionals say it's critical that companies apply them consistently to all customers.

Appearance shouldn't matter.

""Whether they're dressed in suits, whether they're dressed in baggy pants, whether they're dressed in sweatpants, the policy has to apply across the board, equally and fairly,'' says Edward Troiano, owner of Knight Security, a Manhattan-based firm that provides protection services primarily at events and event spaces.

Customers should be made aware of the business' rules, and if someone is believed to be violating them and asked to leave, they should still be treated with kindness and respect, Troiano says.

If they refuse to go, ""then unfortunately, the third step which you never want to do is to say, 'Look, you have to leave or we have to call the cops,' '' he says. When that occurs, ""you've got to make sure all those t's (are crossed) and i's are dotted, that you treated them fairly, you treated them equally and you treated them according to company policy and not because of anything else.''

The Starbucks incident is just the latest in a troubling string of bias allegations lodged by African Americans against businesses ranging from high-end boutiques to chain restaurants. They include accusations by Oscar-nominated actress Gabourey Sidibe that she was racially profiled at a Chanel store and the firing last month of three Applebee's employees in Independence, Mo., who falsely accused two black women diners of skipping out on their bill the day before.

Starbucks stands out because it has embraced a role as a community meeting place where people read, work on computers or just hang out, whether they buy anything or not.

""The kind of discrimination witnessed at Starbucks resonates deeply with African Americans who still suffer the indignity of discrimination by retailers,'' says Todd Cox, director of policy for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

Retailers need to make sure managers understand how to articulate company guidelines, especially amid heightened awareness of implicit biases causing workers to disproportionately mistreat customers of color, says Mark Lipton, graduate professor of management at The New School.

‚ÄúStore managers (need to be) very well trained and extraordinary communicators so that if there is someone who is taking up a lot of space and it‚Äôs during a busy hour, they know how to talk'' to those customers, Lipton said.

When there are allegations of bias and a lawsuit is filed, the burden of proof falls on the person who makes the legal complaint, attorneys say.

Derek Sells, a partner with the Johnnie Cochran Law Firm based in Los Angeles, is not representing the two men arrested at the Philadelphia Starbucks, but he says their case appears to be ""egregious'' and is bolstered by the comments from some white customers who say they've similarly sat in the restaurant without ordering coffee or food, yet were not asked to leave.

""That‚Äôs where you have what‚Äôs called disparate treatment,'' Sells says, ""where two similarly situated individuals of different races are treated differently for doing the same thing.‚Äô‚Äô

Still, guidelines and training may still not be enough to prevent every problem, particularly in the retail or restaurant space where employees often don't stay long on the job, says Dodge of G4S Corporate Risk Services.

""Even when you've done all that, mistakes do happen. People are people. They have biases. And unfortunately, sometimes biases do creep their way into job functions,"" he said.

PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia police have released a recording of a 911 call from the Starbucks employee that led to the controversial arrests of two black men at one of its stores. The incident last week has sparked protests and calls for a boycott on social media, and the company has made repeated apologies.

In the April 12 recording, a woman is heard saying, ""Hi, I have two gentlemen in my cafe that are refusing to make a purchase or leave."" She gives the address of the Starbucks store. The entire call lasts less than 30 seconds.

In the communications between police and dispatch that were also released, someone says ""we have a disturbance at the Starbucks"" and refers to ""a group of males inside causing a disturbance,"" and additional officers are sent. The Starbucks employee never called it a disturbance.

A video taken after police arrived shows officers talking with two black men seated at a table. After a few minutes, officers handcuff the men and lead them outside as other customers say they weren't doing anything wrong. Philadelphia-area media reported that the two were waiting for a friend. Another man in the video is heard saying he was there to meet with the men and calls the arrest ""ridiculous.""

The men were later released without charges.

Responding to national outrage, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson called the arrests ""reprehensible"" and said he wanted to apologize to the two men face-to-face. The company and a lawyer for the two men said they did meet, and Johnson delivered the apology. Starbucks also said the employee who called police no longer works at the store, but declined to give details.

Speaking to local news station WPVI-TV, Philadelphia police commissioner Richard Ross called the situation ""unfortunate"" and said he had received a call from Starbucks' CEO. But he defended his officers' actions and said it doesn't appear they did anything wrong.

""In fact, they were really trying not to make an arrest in this case,"" Ross said. ""They, undoubtedly, had seen instances like this before with people being asked to leave and were accustomed to people just leaving.""

Starbucks announced Tuesday the company will be closing its stores and corporate offices May 29 for company-wide racial bias training.

Speaking to Gayle King on ""CBS This Morning,"" Starbucks' executive chairman Howard Schultz said he is ""embarrassed"" and ""ashamed"" by the incident.

""I think what occurred was reprehensible at every single level,"" Johnson said. ""I think I take it very personally as everyone in our company does and we're committed to making it right."""
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/black-men-arrested-philadelphia-starbucks-say-they-feared-their-lives-n867396,Black men arrested at Philadelphia Starbucks say they feared for their lives,19/04/2018,https://www.nbcnews.com,"The two men arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks spoke out for the first time Thursday, saying they feared for their lives, just hours before the city's police chief apologized for his handling of the fallout.

""I have to do better,"" Police Commissioner Richard Ross said during a news conference, adding, ""Shame on me"" for exacerbating the situation.

The apology came a week after Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, 23-year-old black men, were arrested while sitting at Starbucks in Philadelphia's tony Rittenhouse Square neighborhood waiting for a business meeting. Video of their arrests last Thursday went viral, prompting outrage and accusations of racism against both the coffee chain and the police.

Ross, who is also black, had initially staunchly defended police for their conduct, saying they ""did absolutely nothing wrong.""

But on Thursday, Ross said he fanned the flames with that remark.

""I should have used language that they 'followed the law,'"" he said. ""'Didn't do anything wrong' probably wasn't the best language to use.""

Nelson told The Associated Press that he and Robinson initially brushed it off when a Starbucks manager told him that he couldn't use the restroom because he wasn't a paying customer. He said that he thought nothing of it when he and Robinson, his business partner, were approached at their table and asked if they needed help.

The men declined, explaining that they were just waiting for a business partner to arrive.

A few minutes later, he said, they hardly noticed when police walked into the coffee shop ‚Äî until officers started walking in their direction.

""That's when we knew she called the police on us,"" Nelson told the AP in the men's first interview, referring to the manager.

Nelson and Robinson were taken in handcuffs from the coffee shop, where Robinson has been a customer since he was 15. The video of their arrest, recorded on a white customer's cellphone, outraged many nationwide.

Robinson said that as the men were suddenly led out, he thought about his loved ones and how the afternoon had taken such a turn. As he was taken to jail, Nelson wondered if he'd make it home alive.

""Anytime I'm encountered by cops, I can honestly say it's a thought that runs through my mind,"" Nelson said. ""You never know what's going to happen.""

Notwithstanding his apology, Ross maintained that the officers, who had come to the Starbucks after employees called 911 to say the men were trespassing, had responded appropriately given the information they had received.

Ross said he wasn't aware that Starbucks allows people to sit in its shops without buying anything. Officers were also unaware of the policy, he said.

""They were put, in some ways, in an untenable position. And I know some people don't or refuse to understand that, but it's just a reality,"" Ross said. ""It was in large part me that made the situation worse.""

He also said claims that he didn't understand the issue of racism were outlandish.

""I'm 54 years old. I've been African-American my entire life, and yes, I've been in situations where I've seen racism and prejudice in a variety of ways,"" he said. ""Based on what these police officers responded to, I don't think that was an issue here. As for that manager, that's a whole other ballgame.""

In the week since their arrests, Nelson and Robinson have met with Starbucks' CEO and have started pushing for lasting changes to ensure that what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else.

""This is something that's been going on for years, and everyone's blind to it, but they know what's going on, if you get what I mean,"" Nelson told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday. ""It's not just a black people thing. This is a people thing, and that's exactly what we to see out of this, and that's true change.""

The meeting that they were waiting for at the coffee shop, the men explained, was about a highly anticipated real estate deal.

""We‚Äôve been working on this for months,"" Nelson told ""Good Morning America."" ""We're days away from changing our whole entire situation, our lives, and you about to sit here telling me I can‚Äôt do that? You‚Äôre not doing that.""

Democratic Mayor Jim Kenney, who is white, said that what happened at the Starbucks ""appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018.""

Nelson and Robinson were meeting Andrew Yaffe, a white local businessman, at the Rittenhouse Square Starbucks, where they'd met several times before on a potential real estate opportunity.

They arrived a few minutes early. Three police officers showed up not long after.

Nelson said they weren't questioned but were told to leave immediately.

Yaffe showed up as the men were being handcuffed. He can be seen in the video demanding an explanation. Nelson and Robinson did not resist arrest.

It was hardly their first encounter with police, a rite of passage that becomes a regular occurrence for many black men their age. But neither had been arrested before, setting them apart from many of their peers in the gritty southwest Philadelphia neighborhood where they grew up.

Robinson briefly wondered what he might've done to bring the moment on himself.

""I feel like I fell short,"" he said. ""I'm trying to think of something I did wrong, to put not just me but my brother, my lifelong friend ... in this situation.""

Attorney Stewart Cohen, who is representing Nelson and Robinson, claims that the men were illegally profiled.

Seattle-based Starbucks Corp. has said the location where the arrests occurred has a policy that restrooms are for paying customers only.

Nelson and Robinson spent hours in a jail cell with no outside contact. They were released after midnight, when the district attorney declined to prosecute them. They had no idea that the video of their arrests was making the rounds on the internet.

The day after their arrests, they thought about what to do next.

""You go from being someone who's just trying to be an entrepreneur, having your own dreams and aspirations, and then this happens,"" Nelson said. ""How do you handle it? Do you stand up? Do you fight? Do you sit down and just watch everyone else fight for you? Do you let it slide, like we let everything else slide with injustice?""

Robinson, still focused on the previous day's business deal, called Yaffe to reschedule. Yaffe told him about the video and the traction it had gotten.

Over the weekend, outrage over the video grew, prompting a protest at the Starbucks store and a national boycott. By Monday, the men were set to meet with Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson.

Johnson responded quickly to the arrests, calling them ""reprehensible,"" apologizing and ordering stores closed on the afternoon of May 29 for mandatory training to tackle unconscious bias.

Nelson and Robinson said they're looking for more lasting results and are in mediation proceedings with Starbucks to implement changes, including the posting in stores of a customer bill of rights; the adoption of new policies regarding customer ejections, racial profiling and racial discrimination; and independent investigations of complaints of profiling or discrimination from customers and employees.

Robinson said he appreciates the support the men have received, but boycotting Starbucks is not the solution.

""We need a different type of action ... not words,"" he said. ""It's a time to pay attention and understand what's really going on. We do want a seat at the table."""

The arrests, recorded on a white customer‚Äôs cellphone video, galvanized people around the country who saw the exchange as an example of racism.

The men have met with the CEO of Starbucks and are pushing for meaningful change so what happened to them does not happen to anyone else.

Police this week released a recording of the call from the Starbucks employee that led to the arrest. In it, a woman is heard saying the men refused to ‚Äúmake a purchase or leave‚Äù.

Starbucks has promised to shut all 8,000 company-owned stores across the US on 29 May to train employees about unconscious bias.

Nelson and Robinson, black men who became best friends in the fourth grade, were taken in handcuffs from the Starbucks in Philadelphia‚Äôs tony Rittenhouse Square neighborhood, where Robinson has been a customer since he was 15.



‚ÄúWe were there for a real reason, a real deal that we were working on,‚Äù Robinson explained. ‚ÄúWe put in a lot of time, energy, effort ‚Ä¶ We were at a moment that could have a positive impact on a whole ladder of people, lives, families. So I was like, ‚ÄòNo, you‚Äôre not stopping that right now.‚Äù‚Äô

The Democratic mayor, Jim Kenney, who is white, said what happened at the Starbucks ‚Äúappears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018‚Äù. The police commissioner, Richard Ross, who is black, said in a Facebook post that arresting officers ‚Äúdid absolutely nothing wrong‚Äù, and added that Nelson and Robinson were disrespectful to officers.

Ross said officers did what they were supposed to do and were professional in their dealings with the men, ‚Äúand instead they got the opposite back‚Äù.

Nelson and Robinson originally were supposed to meet Andrew Yaffe, a white local businessman, at a Starbucks across town. But the plan changed, and they agreed to meet at the Rittenhouse Square location, where they had met several times before on a potential real estate opportunity.

The black men arrived a few minutes early. Three police officers showed up not long after.

Nelson said they were not questioned but were told to leave immediately.

Yaffe showed up as the men were being handcuffed. He can be seen in the video demanding an explanation for the officers‚Äô actions. Nelson and Robinson did not resist arrest, confused and unsure of what to think or what might happen next.

‚ÄúWhen you know that you did nothing wrong, how do you really react to it?‚Äù Nelson said. ‚ÄúYou can either be ignorant or you can show some type of sophistication and act like you have class. That was the choice we had.‚Äù

It was hardly their first encounter with police, a rite of passage that becomes a regular occurrence for many black men their age. But neither had been arrested before, setting them apart from many of their peers in the gritty south-west Philadelphia neighborhood where they grew up.

Attorney Stewart Cohen, representing Nelson and Robinson, said the men were illegally profiled. He pointed to Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race in hotels, restaurants, theaters and other public accommodations.

Seattle-based Starbucks has said the location where the arrests occurred has a policy that restrooms are for paying customers only.

Nelson and Robinson spent hours in a jail cell with no outside contact and no sense of what would happen next. They were released after midnight, when the district attorney declined to prosecute them for trespassing. They had no idea the video of their arrests was making the rounds on the internet.

Over the weekend, attention and outrage over the video grew, prompting a protest at the local Starbucks restaurant and a national boycott. By Monday, the men were set to meet with Starbucks‚Äô CEO, Kevin Johnson, to discuss what happened.

Johnson has responded quickly to public outcry around the arrests, calling them ‚Äúreprehensible‚Äù, apologizing and ordering stores closed for mandatory training to tackle unconscious bias.

Nelson and Robinson said they are looking for more lasting results and are in mediation proceedings with Starbucks to implement changes, including the posting in stores of a customer bill of rights; the adoption of new policies regarding customer ejections, racial profiling and racial discrimination; and independent investigations of complaints of profiling or discrimination from customers and employees.

Robinson said he appreciates the public support the men have received but anger and boycotting Starbucks are not the solution.

‚ÄúWe need a different type of action ‚Ä¶ not words,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a time to pay attention and understand what‚Äôs really going on. We do want a seat at the table.‚Äù

The two men were also interviewed on ABC‚Äôs Good Morning America on Thursday.

‚ÄúI want to make sure that this doesn‚Äôt happen again,‚Äù Robinson said. ‚ÄúSo what I want is for a young man or young men to not be traumatized by this and instead motivated, inspired.‚Äù

Asked what the men thought about criticism that they had violated the store‚Äôs rules, he said: ‚ÄúRules are rules, what is right is right, and what is wrong is wrong.‚Äù"

What began as an opportunity to talk real estate at a Philadelphia coffee shop and ended in the arrest of two black men has launched a week of outraged protest, accusations of racial discrimination and vows from Starbucks to do better. And now those men are speaking out for the first time about what it has all meant to them.

Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson ‚Äî the 23-year-olds at the center of it all ‚Äî say they just hope the incident will lead to change.

Also Thursday, the Philadelphia police commissioner changed course, joining Starbucks in taking at least partial responsibility for what happened.

Richard Ross struck a conciliatory note at a news conference, saying, ""I fully acknowledge that I played a significant role in making [the incident] worse.""

Last weekend, Ross had said in a video statement that ""these officers did absolutely nothing wrong"" and that they were legally obligated to respond to Starbucks' report that the men were trespassing. But on Thursday, he said, ""I should have said the officers acted within the scope of the law, and not that they didn't do anything wrong.""

When he saw police entering the Starbucks last Thursday, Robinson told ABC's Good Morning America, it did not register that he and his companion might be the ones in trouble.

""They can't be here for us,"" he said he was thinking as he and Nelson awaited a third man for a scheduled meeting.

Nelson said that he had asked to use the restroom and that an employee informed him it was for paying customers only.

""And I just left it at that.""

But the manager didn't.

A police report states the men cursed at the manager after she told them bathrooms are for customers only.

She called 911 to report that the men were not making a purchase and were refusing to leave.

It reportedly took just two minutes from their arrival to her call for help.

Last weekend, Ross said officers had asked the men ""politely to leave"" three times because Starbucks said they were trespassing. After the men refused, Ross said, the police made the arrest.

""It didn't really hit me what was going on ‚Äî that it was real ‚Äî until I'm being double-locked and my hands [are] behind my back,"" Robinson told ABC News.

In a separate interview with The Associated Press, Nelson said that he was worried about the situation spinning out of control and that he might possibly die.

""Anytime I'm encountered by cops, I can honestly say it's a thought that runs through my mind,"" Nelson said. ""You never know what's going to happen.""

The AP reports that the men ‚Äî who have been best friends since the fourth grade ‚Äî had never been arrested before. And Robinson said he had been a customer at the Rittenhouse Square Starbucks since he was 15.

The men spent several hours in custody before being released.

Starbucks declined to press charges.

ABC's Robin Roberts asked the men how they would respond to those who say they violated Starbucks policy by not buying anything.

""I understand that ‚Äî rules are rules,"" Robinson said. ""But what's right is right and what's wrong is wrong.""

Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson ‚Äî who met with the men on Monday ‚Äî says the company was in the wrong.

""Our practices and training led to a bad outcome ‚Äî the basis for the call to the Philadelphia police department was wrong,"" Johnson said in a statement Saturday.

Ross, the police commissioner, outlined the confusion over just what those practices are or whether an official company policy about making a purchase exists or is known.

""While this is apparently a well-known fact with Starbucks customers, not everyone is aware that people spend long hours in Starbucks and aren't necessarily expected to make a purchase,"" he said, adding that he apologizes to Nelson and Robinson.

Ross said that he had initially misunderstood that business model and that it is ""reasonable to believe"" the arresting officers did not know about it either.

A Starbucks spokesperson told The Washington Post, ""In this particular store, the guidelines were that partners must ask unpaying customers to leave the store, and police were to be called if they refused.""

But for its part, Starbucks has been focusing its messaging on racial bias rather than on store policy.

Starbucks says it will close its 8,000-plus stores in the U.S. for the afternoon on May 29 to conduct ""racial-bias education geared toward preventing discrimination in our stores.""

The men's lawyer, Stewart Cohen, says a retired federal judge is overseeing mediation with Starbucks.

Robinson told ABC News that he hopes the situation can serve as a lesson for ""young men to not be traumatized by this and instead [be] motivated, inspired.""

Nelson said he wants to ""help people understand it's not just a black people thing; it's a people thing.""

Ross, who is black, said, ""The issue of race in this situation is not lost on me,"" adding that he shouldn't be the one making it worse.

He said Philadelphia police have now come up with an unspecified new policy ""that guides our officers on how to deal with similar situations."""

Men arrested at Starbucks were there for business meeting hoping to change 'our lives‚Äô

The two black men who were arrested at a Starbucks in downtown Philadelphia last week and accused of trespassing say they were there for a business meeting that they had hoped would change their lives.

Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson came forward this morning on ABC News' ""Good Morning America"" to publicly share their story for the first time.

The 23-year-old entrepreneurs and longtime friends said they were waiting to meet a potential business partner at the Starbucks in Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square neighborhood April 12 when a barista asked them whether they wanted to order anything. They declined and told her they were just there for a quick meeting, they said.

Nelson said he immediately asked to use the restroom when they walked in but was informed it was for paying customers only. So the pair sat at a table and waited for the person with whom they were scheduled to meet.

Then they saw police officers enter the store and speak with the manager, they said.

""I was thinking, 'They can't be here for us,'"" Robinson said in the interview with ""GMA"" co-anchor Robin Roberts. ""We have meetings at Starbucks all the time.""

They didn't think anything of it until the officers approached their table and told them they needed to leave, they said.

""It was just, 'Get out, you have to leave. You're not buying anything, so you shouldn't be here,'"" Nelson told ""GMA.""

They said they calmly told the officers they were there for a meeting, and Robinson said he even called the person for whom they were waiting. But the officers repeatedly insisted that they leave, they said.

""It's a real estate meeting. We‚Äôve been working on this for months,"" Robinson said. ""We're days away from changing our whole entire situation, our lives, and you about to sit here telling me I can‚Äôt do that? You‚Äôre not doing that.""

The officers ultimately handcuffed Nelson and Robinson, and escorted them out of the Starbucks and into a squad car before taking them to the police station. Both men were later freed and the charges they were facing -- trespassing and disturbance -- were dropped that night.

An onlooker, Melissa DePino, captured the incident on video, which has been viewed more than 10 million times online and prompted protests outside the coffee giant's location on Spruce Street.

DePino, a 50-year-old writer and mother of two, told ABC News a Starbucks barista shouted from behind the counter at the two men to make a purchase or leave.

""They were sitting quietly minding their own business, and waiting for their friend to come,"" she said in an interview Sunday.

Robinson said police never read them their Miranda rights when they were handcuffed and they were held in custody for eight hours.

""There was no reasoning,"" he said. ""They had nothing. They just kept using ‚Äòdefiant trespassing‚Äô as their excuse for putting us behind bars.""

The Philadelphia Police Department did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment this morning. But Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross Jr. said in a video testimonial released Saturday that his officers ""did absolutely nothing wrong.""

""I can tell you candidly these officers did a service they were called to do,"" Ross said.

The police commissioner also accused the men of being disrespectful to the officers and said that both were given several chances to leave, but they refused.

""On three different occasions the officers asked the two males politely to leave the location because they were being asked to leave by employees because they were trespassing,"" he said. ""Instead the males continued to refuse as they had told the employees and they told the officers they were not leaving.""

Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson released a statement last Saturday night apologizing to the two men on behalf of the company.

""The video shot by customers is very hard to watch and the actions in it are not representative of our Starbucks mission and values,"" Johnson said in the statement. ""Creating an environment that is both safe and welcoming for everyone is paramount for every store. Regretfully, our practices and training led to a bad outcome -- the basis for the call to the Philadelphia police department was wrong. Our store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did.""

In an interview Monday morning on ""GMA,"" Johnson said he will order managers to undergo training on how to spot ""unconscious bias.""

""I'll say the circumstances surrounding the incident and the outcome at our store on Thursday were reprehensible,"" he said. ""They were wrong, and for that, I personally apologize to the gentlemen that visited our store.""

A Starbucks spokeswoman subsequently confirmed to ABC News that the store manager who called police no longer works there.

The next day, Starbucks announced in a statement that it will close more than 8,000 company-owned stores across the nation for the afternoon of May 29 to train its staff on how to avoid ""racial bias"" in an effort to prevent ""discrimination in our stores.""

Stewart Cohen, the attorney representing Nelson and Robinson, said his clients have met face to face with the Starbucks' CEO, but it's not enough.

""Starbucks holds itself open as a place for people to meet and to have public conversations; those are words from their website,"" Cohen said on ""GMA"" this morning. ""The apologies are fine, but what we need to do is have some action by Starbucks with respect to this situation.

""There has to be real and meaningful discussions,"" he added.

At a press conference at police headquarters, Police Commissioner Richard Ross said he should have said the arresting officers acted within the bounds of the law, and he added that the department as a whole needs to do better in communicating with the public.

‚ÄúIt starts at the top. It starts with me,‚Äù Ross said. ‚ÄúMessaging is important, and I failed miserably in this regard.‚Äù

The public apology came a week after police took Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson into custody at a Rittenhouse Square Starbucks when the store manager called 911, claiming the two men failed to buy anything and refused to leave.

The men said they were at Starbucks for a business meeting and were waiting for a third man to arrive. The man, real estate investor Andrew Yaffe, showed up during the arrest.

Ross said he and the officers did not realize that Starbucks routinely allows people to hang out in its cafes without making a purchase.

‚ÄúI can appreciate ‚Äî in light of the Starbucks policy and how well known it is to many ‚Äî why these two men were appalled when they were asked to leave,‚Äù Ross said. ‚ÄúFor this reason, me, I apologize to them.‚Äù

Protesters seek departmental changes

The incident led to protests in Philadelphia and beyond over what many people saw as a prime example of modern-day racial bias. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said it ‚Äúappears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018.‚Äù

The issue of race was not lost on Ross, who is black. ‚ÄúI should not at all be the person that is a party to making anything worse, relative to race relations. Shame on me if, in any way, I‚Äôve done that,‚Äù he said.

Ross said the police department was working on a new policy for handling similar trespassing calls. The mayor‚Äôs office said Thursday evening the policy would be finalized and released by end of next week.

The chief‚Äôs apology was well received by people who gathered outside police headquarters Thursday night for a protest put on by POWER, an interfaith organization based in Pennsylvania. But protesters said they also wanted city leaders to take action to fix what went wrong during the incident."

""I should have said the officers acted within the scope of the law and not that they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong,"" Ross said during a press conference Thursday. ""Words are very important.""

On April 12, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson were arrested at a downtown Philadelphia Starbucks and accused of trespassing and disturbance after a manager called 911, telling dispatchers that two men had refused to make a purchase or leave.

The longtime friends, both 23, had just sat down at a table for a business meeting, they told ABC News on Thursday.

Cellphone video of two Philadelphia police officers handcuffing the men and escorting them out of the store caused outrage on social media after it was viewed more than 10 million times.

In a video testimonial released Saturday, Ross also accused Nelson and Robinson of being disrespectful to the officers and said they were both given several chances to leave, but refused.

Ross admitted today that he ""played a significant role"" in making the situation worse in his initial reaction to the ""unfortunate incident.""

Before the arrest, Ross was not aware of the Starbucks business model, in which people ""spend long hours in Starbucks and aren't necessarily expected to make a purchase,"" he said, adding that it is reasonable to believe the arresting officers didn't know that either.

While Ross said the issue of race is not lost on him, he also defended the actions of his officers, saying that the fact that they were at the scene for well over 10 minutes suggests that they were trying to resolve the situation.

At the time, the department did not have a policy for dealing with similar situations, Ross said. A guideline has since been created and will be released soon, the police commissioner said.

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney also issued an apology to Nelson and Robinson, saying that arrest caused ""many Philadelphians"" to witness and relive ""the trauma of racial profiling.

""I want to apologize on behalf of the City of Philadelphia to Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson for the experience they‚Äôve been put through,"" Kenney said. ""I want to acknowledge their pain and the pain of so many others, and commit our City to healing it together over the coming days, weeks and months.""

Kenney also lauded the police commissioner for the ""courage"" it took to apologize for his initial response.

""Sometimes courage is as simple as a willingness to evaluate your own words and actions, and to account for them,"" Kenney said. ""... I applaud his ability to reflect on this very difficult week and to articulate his changed perspective. It‚Äôs that courage and self-reflection that makes the Commissioner such an effective leader.""

Kenney said the ""current realities of race relations and bias in 2018"" will require ""ongoing re-evaluations.""

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross apologized Thursday to two black men who were arrested while waiting for a business meeting at Starbucks, saying he made the situation worse by initially defending his officers‚Äô actions.

Ross‚Äô apology came at a news conference on the same day the men ‚Äì Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson ‚Äì told ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù they were handcuffed within minutes of arriving at the store April 12 for a business meeting.

Ross said he was not aware that Starbucks allows people to sit in stores without making a purchase.

‚ÄúI can appreciate, in light of the Starbucks policy and how well known it is to many, why these two men were appalled when asked to leave and for this reason, me, I apologize to them,‚Äù Ross told reporters.

Mayor Jim Kenney also apologized to the men on Thursday, acknowledging ‚Äúa difficult week for many Philadelphians witnessing and reliving the trauma of racial profiling.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to acknowledge their pain and the pain of so many others, and commit our city to healing it together over the coming days, weeks and months,‚Äù he said in a statement.

Kenney also praised Ross‚Äô ‚Äúability to reflect on this very difficult week, and to articulate his changed perspective.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe current realities of race relations and bias in 2018 warrant ongoing re-evaluations by each and every one of us,‚Äù he said.

Last week, a store manager called police and said the two men were sitting in the store without placing an order. They were arrested for trespassing. The person the men were waiting for arrived as they were being arrested.

After a Twitter video emerged of the men being escorted out in handcuffs, Ross initially said the officers ‚Äúdid absolutely nothing wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor starters, I should have said the officers acted within the scope of the law and not that they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong,‚Äù Ross said Thursday. ‚ÄúWords are very important.‚Äù

The commissioner said new policy guidelines will be unveiled soon on how officers should respond to similar calls.

Kenney said a new policy on police calls for ‚Äúdefiant trespass‚Äù has been drafted, with the review process to be completed in a week.

The police internal affairs division investigation is to be completed by midweek, he said. Philadelphia‚Äôs Commission on Human Relations is also investigating the incident.

Kenney said the number of pedestrian stops by police has dropped 50% from 2015 to 2017.

Nelson and Robinson told ABC they went to Starbucks for a business meeting they believed would change their lives.

Instead, they walked out in handcuffs shortly after Nelson asked to use the restroom. He was told it was only for paying customers. A white store employee called 911 minutes later.

‚ÄúThe issue of race in this situation is not lost on me,‚Äù said Ross, 54, who is black.

‚ÄúThe optics are not lost on me. It is obvious the issue of race is indicative of a larger problem in our society, and I should not at all be the person that is a party to making anything worse relative to race relations. Shame on me if in any way I have done that. ‚Ä¶ I have to do better.‚Äù

No charges were filed against the men. The video of the incident went viral and ignited protests and calls for boycotts.

‚ÄúI was thinking, they can‚Äôt be here for us,‚Äù Robinson said of the police. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt really hit me what was going on, that it was real, ‚Äòtil I was being double-locked with my hands behind my back.‚Äù

On Monday, the two men met with Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson, who apologized.

An attorney for the two men told ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù that Starbucks has agreed to a proposal to enter into mediation with a retired federal judge.

The store employee who called 911 is no longer with the company. Starbucks has not said under what circumstances the employee left.

Starbucks plans to close its 8,000 company-owned stores in the United States for the afternoon on May 29 to teach employees about racial bias. The training will be provided to about 175,000 workers.

Ross said he does not believe race played a role in the officers‚Äô actions, but added, ‚ÄúAs for that manager, that‚Äôs a whole other ballgame.‚Äù"

It has been a month since the arrest of two black men at a Philadelphia Starbucks spun the Seattle-based coffee chain into a whirlwind of controversy and sparked a national discussion about racial bias.

A lot has happened since then ‚Äî customers have called for boycotts, protests ensued, apologies and criticisms poured in, and racial bias training is scheduled for Starbucks employees later this month.

It all started with a short video shared on Twitter of the pair ‚Äî Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, both 23 ‚Äî being taken out of the store at 18th and Spruce Streets in handcuffs after the manager called police. They had been asked to leave because they hadn't bought anything, and refused.

Here's a rundown of events since April 12.

Friday, May 11

Starbucks' bathrooms will be open to everyone, executive chairman Howard Schultz said during the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington. ""In terms of the bathroom, we're going to have to make sure that ‚Äì we don't want to become a public bathroom, but we're going to make the right decision 100 percent of the time and give people the key, because we don't want anyone at Starbucks to feel as if we are not giving access to you to the bathroom because you are less than,"" he said according to a transcript of the conversation on the Atlantic Council's website. ""We want you to be more than.""

Thursday, May 3

Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson appeared on Good Morning America for the second time since the video of their arrest went viral. The both wish to focus on the positivity that has come out of the incident, including the program they plan to start for young entrepreneurs. ""Looking at how we took a negative and turned it into a positive, that's really all we want,"" Robinson told anchor Robin Roberts. ""Not to focus on the negative, but just to focus on positive outcome.""

Wednesday, May 2

Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson have reached separate agreements with the city and Starbucks following the mid-April incident. The city has agreed to pay them $1 each and set up a $200,000 program for young entrepreneurs at their request. They also reached an agreement with the Seattle-based coffee chain that ""will include a financial settlement as well as continued listening and dialogue between the parties,"" Starbucks announced in a statement.

Sunday, April 22

Another protest was held outside of the Starbucks at 18th and Spruce Streets, this time including more than 100 members of Omega Psi Psi ' the fraternity Rashon Nelson belonged to while attending Bloomsberg University ‚Äî from across the nation. ""My skin color is not a crime,"" Terrance Jenkins, president of the graduate chapter of Omega Psi Phi, which advises the undergraduate chapter at Bloomsburg, said during the event.

Thursday, April 19

Police Commissioner Richard Ross said he made the situation surrounding the arrests worse, by saying his officers did nothing wrong. He said he would have used different words had he known Starbucks allowed people to stay in its cafes for hours without making a purchase. The officers also did not know that, he said, but asserted that they acted within the scope of the law and were respectful to the two men. ""They were put in an untenable position,"" said Ross, who apologized to the men and announced the department had drawn up new guidelines on handling future calls. He did not identify the officers. Still angered by Ross' initial response to the arrests, dozens of people on protested outside police headquarters and marched to City Hall, chanting, ""Police Department, you can't hide, we can see your dirty side."" One protester said Ross ""showed his true colors"" when he defended the officers. The two men spoke publicly, taking their stories nationally by giving interviews to both the Associated Press and ABC's Good Morning America. Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, friends since elementary school, are hoping it won't happen again. Robinson noted that he's not sure why he was arrested. Nelson said he looks at the incident as a ""stepping stone"" for change. ""I want to make sure that ‚Ä¶ this situation doesn't happen again,"" Robinson said on GMA. ""So what I want is for a young man or young men to not be traumatized by this and instead motivated, inspired.""

Wednesday, April 18

Executive Chairman Howard Schultz appeared on CBS This Morning, saying he was both ""ashamed"" and ""embarrassed."" POWER, an interfaith group, announced a rally and march for police accountability to be held Thursday, partially in response to Police Commissioner Richard Ross' comments that the arresting officers acted properly. Inquirer and Daily News reporters spoke to Rashon Nelson's neighbors in Southwest Philly. Those who know Nelson portrayed the former Bloomsburg University fraternity brother and father in favorable light. ""Rashon is a good kid, he's a good father, and he's not a thug,"" said John Gossett, 48.

Tuesday, April 17

Starbucks announced it would close all of its U.S. stores for the afternoon of May 29 while its employees undergo ""racial-bias education."" ""Closing our stores for racial-bias training is just one step in a journey that requires dedication from every level of our company and partnerships in our local communities,"" Starbucks chief executive Kevin Johnson said in a statement. The Philadelphia Police Department released recordings of the original 20-second 911 call from Starbucks and radio traffic between officers who responded and dispatchers. In the 911 call, a woman said there were ""two gentlemen"" in the ""cafe who are refusing to make a purchase or leave."" In the subsequent radio traffic, a man reported a ""group of males"" was ""causing a disturbance"" before calling for backup and a supervisor. The police incident report, obtained Tuesday by the Inquirer and Daily News, notes that the two men cursed at the store manager and refused to leave even though officers asked ""multiple times."" It also accused the men of insulting police by saying, ""Cops don't know the laws,"" and ""Y'all make 45G a year,"" remarks to which Police Commissioner Richard Ross alluded in his explanation of the events, released in a Facebook video Saturday.

The city announced it would look into other incidents at the same Starbucks location.

Monday, April 16

Protests at the store on 18th and Market Streets continued, while CEO Kevin Johnson appeared on ABC's Good Morning America to issue a public apology. Johnson also flew to Philadelphia meet with the two men as well as government officials and community leaders.

Mayor Kenney and the Police Advisory Commission both said the officers who responded to the Starbucks followed procedures.

Sunday, April 15

Black Lives Matter protester Asa Khalif led a protest at the Starbucks at 18th and Spruce Streets where many demanded the firing of the employee who called police. About 75 people attended. ""I know the question has come up in terms of whether or not the manager should be fired, and we take full responsibility,"" Starbucks regional vice president Camille Hymes said. ""We put her in a position that did not allow her to be set up for success ‚Äì or those two men."" A photo of Khalif armed with a bullhorn inside of the store, taken by Inquirer photographer Michael Bryant, would later be widely used on Twitter as a meme.

Friday, April 13 ‚Äì Saturday, April 14

National outrage over the viral video began to mount. Many took to social media to call the incident racist, while the hashtags @boycottStarbucks and #StarbucksWhileBlack become widely used. Police Commissioner Richard Ross took to Facebook to stress that the arresting officers did nothing wrong. Later that night, CEO Kevin Johnson penned a letter to the company's ""partners and customers,"" noting that the ""disheartening situation"" ""led to a reprehensible outcome."" ""I am heartbroken to see Philadelphia in the headlines for an incident that ‚Äî at least based on what we know at this point ‚Äî appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018,"" Mayor Kenney said in his own statement. ""For many, Starbucks is not just a place to buy a cup of coffee, but a place to meet up with friends or family members, or to get some work done. Like all retail establishments in our city, Starbucks should be a place where everyone is treated the same, no matter the color of their skin."" Police and the company began separate investigations.

When police arrived, the men were arrested for trespassing. A bystander caught the encounter on video, which showed the men resigned to their fate as other white patrons protested the arrest, and the incident went viral.

Starbucks is now in full-on damage-control mode, with plans to shut down its stores nationwide for an afternoon of employee unconscious bias training. Meanwhile, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross said that the officers acted according to protocol, but his department has launched an internal investigation.

The events have sparked yet another conversation about what it means to be a black person in a public, predominantly white space, but it‚Äôs unclear whether this will lead to any real shift. Below is an edited and condensed conversation between Slate writers Aisha Harris and Jamelle Bouie, NPR‚Äôs Gene Demby, and sociology professor Tressie McMillan Cottom about the significance of this happening at Starbucks in particular and about navigating public spaces while black.

Aisha Harris: OK, it‚Äôs not like we haven‚Äôt seen this play out time and time again in both the media and our personal lives. So how did you react when you first read about what happened at Starbucks?

Tressie McMillan Cottom: I have post-traumatic stress disorder at this point with videos of white people doing horrible, routine racism. Like a lot of black people, I suspect, reading the latest on this primed all the emotions of my experiences of being profiled or othered in white spaces. And then you deal with the inevitable shock from white people, which in its way only reinforces how utterly hypervisible yet invisible we are. The constant shock to white sensibilities is part of the black trauma.

Jamelle Bouie: Right. I‚Äôm not sure that I had any reaction beyond, ‚ÄúAh, another example of black people getting arrested for the crime of‚Äîchecks notes‚Äîexisting in public space.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe constant shock to white sensibilities is part of the black trauma.‚Äù ‚Äî Tressie McMillan Cottom

Harris: Same. I think my blood boiled for about 10 seconds, and then I was like, ‚ÄúWelp, white people gonna white.‚Äù Gene, this actually happened in your ‚Äòhood, your hometown. Was that Starbucks even there when you were growing up?

Gene Demby: I don‚Äôt remember it being there. I grew up not too far from there, maybe a 20-minute walk, in South Philly. I guess gentrifiers are calling it Southwest Center City now. That area, Rittenhouse Square, has always been sort of wealthy and hoity-toity. But because of how centrally located it is, it‚Äôs pretty diverse during the day, full of people passing through on their ways to and from work and shopping. So the neighborhood‚Äôs residents are super white, but you wouldn‚Äôt know it if you walked through there during work hours, if that makes sense.

Advertisement

Bouie: I had a conversation with a reader over email who insisted that one should think of it as a diverse space. But having been there on many occasions, it strikes me as more akin to somewhere like the Downtown Mall in Charlottesville, Virginia‚Äîputatively diverse, but curated for the experience of white people.

McMillan Cottom: White people‚Äôs definition of diverse is fundamentally different than ours, of course. Performative safe diversity that maintains majority culture is exactly what Starbucks and places like Charlottesville‚Äôs Downtown Mall traffic in. Starbucks takes this diverse, cosmopolitan form of colonized spaces to its logical ends. It is their whole shtick, which is why they had to work hard and quick to get this narrative back on track.

Advertisement

Advertisement

Demby: What was so interesting was how resigned those dudes [in the Starbucks video] were. Like, ‚ÄúThis is some bullshit, but you can‚Äôt argue with the weather.‚Äù

There was a big report on stop-and-frisks in Philly for the year of 2015 that came out last year. It found that, like, 68 percent of the pedestrian stops in that police patrol area around Rittenhouse Square were of black people. But that‚Äôs just pedestrian stops. That‚Äôs not the contact that black people in the area may have had because members of the public sicced the police on them.

Advertisement

Bouie: Gene‚Äôs bit of data gets to something that, I think, gets lost in discussions of police abuse and reform. The police act autonomously, yes, but also they are often called with the express purpose of regulating the presence of black people in a space. Randomly select a group of 10 black people, and at least one of them will have a story of the cops being called on them and their friends for no particular reason.

Advertisement

McMillan Cottom: In a broken-windows approach to policing, being black is the broken window. It is just cause for aggressive policing. The Philadelphia police commissioner wasn‚Äôt wrong when he said the officers did their job. They did. And that‚Äôs the problem.

‚ÄúIn a broken-windows approach to policing, being black is the broken window. It is just cause for aggressive policing.‚Äù ‚Äî Tressie McMillan Cottom

Harris: Yes. While Starbucks is getting this image makeover, no one is questioning why this is a justified method for regulating space in the first place. Maybe the cops don‚Äôt have to arrest these guys for not ordering fast enough.

Demby: I was talking to Phillip Atiba Goff, the co-founder of the Center for Policing Equity and a Philly dude, who said it‚Äôs a mistake to partition the public‚Äôs racial bias off from the police‚Äôs racial bias. The police were called into this situation, as a colleague said, to mediate a misunderstanding, like they were RAs in a dorm and not armed agents of the state with broad discretion to use violence and detain people. And so there‚Äôs this way that the reasonableness of white people‚Äôs fears about black people is backed up by institutions. Folks call the cops to back them up in disagreements with other members of the public in ostensibly public spaces open to everyone.

Advertisement

McMillan Cottom: It reminds me of that story from years back where the Fox News guy was surprised that the black eatery Sylvia‚Äôs in Harlem was so civilized. There is no room in white imagination of a black civilized space. By default, all black people, to the extent that we may make a space black, pose a risk of uncivilized consumerism.

Advertisement

Advertisement

Demby: To piggyback off Tressie‚Äôs point on race and space, can we talk about who Starbucks is for?

McMillan Cottom: They commodified this idea of the ‚Äúthird space‚Äù‚Äîthe space that isn‚Äôt home and that isn‚Äôt work. The thing is, this space is supposed to be made by the culture. Starbucks said, ‚ÄúOh no, we will make it about consumption.‚Äù And black people are always going to lose in that version of a third space, because the right to transact is lost when all the ideas of property and police become a tool for a basic-ass cup of coffee. The Starbucks third space is a place where white people can consume an idea that they‚Äôre being in a diverse public, while their $5 coffee buys them the safety of a barista who can call the police on someone to keep the space safe for them. Which is to say, it isn‚Äôt for us.

Advertisement

Harris: Remember how they Disney-fied and commodified the concept of the indie, small-business coffee house buy selling those compilation CDs that were basically white adult contemporary‚ÄîNorah Jones, Train, and so on? The entire aesthetic is, for lack of a better word, whitewashed.

Also, remember ‚ÄúRace Together‚Äù?

Bouie: Oof, I completely forgot about that.

Demby: Oh, yes. The barista-just-wants-to-have-a-friendly-chat-about-race campaign!

McMillan Cottom: They really want to be the guy in the office who ‚Äúgets‚Äù it. They have to be that guy, though, because their whole business plan rests on the demographics of a place like Rittenhouse Square. You need cheap labor for the baristas. You need foot traffic and transportation. You need urban-suburban density. All of those things come with ‚Äúdiversity.‚Äù

Sorry, but I gotta do this.

Advertisement

Demby: Don‚Äôt do it, Tressie! But yes! If you think of ‚Äútalking about race‚Äù as just getting to understand each other better ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs, I suppose, well-intentioned? That campaign, which cratered almost as soon as it was announced, made me think of something I think a theologian at Boston University named Dan Hauge said to me on Twitter once: ‚ÄúI think one issue is, we whites imagine the endgame of anti-racism as harmonious relationships rather than equal power to shape society.‚Äù

Advertisement

Harris: Kumbaya vs. ‚ÄúI just wanna be treated fairly like everyone else.‚Äù

Demby: If you think that the implications of race are ultimately that we just have different foods and idioms‚Äîthat fixing racism is about dialogue and talking it out and not about fundamentally rethinking how our society is arranged‚Äîthen yeah, that ill-fated Starbucks campaign makes sense.

Bouie: The idea that the end stage of anti-racism is that black people (and others!) have equal ability to shape society, including notions of what is public and who it is for, is basically foreign to a lot of people.

Harris: Everything you all have just said, plus Jamelle‚Äôs piece about the concept of white spaces vs. black spaces in light of this incident, has gotten me thinking about how blackness can be rendered both invisible and visible in white spaces, depending upon how it might benefit whiteness or play into white people‚Äôs fears of blackness. When a white person feels threatened, like in a Starbucks, or when they see a ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù black person on their block, we are a stark aberration to be dealt with swiftly and handily. Yet in other white spaces, like a restaurant where you are supposed to be served, you might be rendered invisible by your server. I cannot count how many times I‚Äôve dined somewhere that was √ºber-white and felt as though I was being ignored because of my blackness.

McMillan Cottom: So a few months ago I try to go to a yoga class. I pull up and park in the lot attached to the building. I am early, so I sit and eat my snack and read a book for a while. First, a white woman did that aggressive ‚ÄúHello‚Äù thing at me through the window. Five minutes later, the front-desk employee came outside to tell me they don‚Äôt allow trespassing. Automobiles are supposed to be a space with a boundary. We‚Äôre socially invisible in them. We purchase them so, in a way, we‚Äôre in our own property when in them. Not even then could I be visible as a paying customer (which I was‚ÄîI had paid online). But also I was hypervisible as a security threat.

Demby: Damn, Tressie.

McMillan Cottom: That‚Äôs how that visible-yet-invisible thing works over and over and over again. In all these routine transactions we have to make to be part of a culture, we have this constant friction.

I sometimes daydream about what it must be like to move around frictionless in this society. The closest I come to it is when I am abroad. But it must be amazing‚Äîso amazing that white people will call the National Guard to protect it at all costs.

Demby: Karen Attiah of the Washington Post pointed to a bunch of other stories like this Starbucks one, in which black folks had the police sicced on them for being ‚Ä¶ in public. Skip Gates. The girl who was yoked up by that cop at the pool party in McKinney, Texas.

Harris: Has anyone else besides Tressie had an experience along the lines of being invisible/visible like this Starbucks story?

Demby: Oh, God.

Harris: As soon as I typed that, I was like, ‚ÄúMaybe I should rephrase this as, ‚ÄòChoose one, from the many I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve had.‚Äô ‚Äù

Demby: LOL.

Bouie: Hah!

McMillan Cottom: There are the big ones like the yoga studio, but I also want to shout out the more muted versions of this. It‚Äôs the extra question that, to be asked, had to assume that you are somehow in the wrong place. ‚ÄúAre you looking for X?‚Äù when you‚Äôre perfectly fine, for example. Or, ‚ÄúThis is the [insert obvious description of the place you‚Äôre standing],‚Äù which is a way for front-line staffers and just regular white people to initiate an exchange where we are supposed to explain why we‚Äôre there. It‚Äôs that we are always somehow in the wrong place. It looks like service, but it is social control.

Bouie: I was just thinking about those muted versions, Tressie.

Demby: Yep. Every time I‚Äôm in a department store. Especially if I‚Äôm wearing a hoodie. Especially if I‚Äôm not wearing my glasses.

Bouie: What‚Äôs difficult in talking about those is that it‚Äôs hard to convey what that feels like to people who don‚Äôt experience it.

McMillan Cottom: I asked someone recently if I have resting lost face. Why do people assume I‚Äôm so lost all the damn time? Of course, we know why, but yeah.

Bouie: I think, to someone who isn‚Äôt faced with it all the time, it just seems innocuous. ‚ÄúOh, they want to help.‚Äù But if I‚Äôm clearly looking at‚Äîto use a recent example‚Äîa piece of photography equipment and someone comes up to ask, ‚ÄúWhat can I help you find?‚Äù I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm being helped at all!

Harris: Nine times out of 10, they‚Äôre really trying to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you not steal.

McMillan Cottom: You know that‚Äôs what the question is, because if you don‚Äôt answer it with an explanation, they go a little bananas. I do that now, by the way, for cheap entertainment. ‚ÄúHi, can I help you find ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù and I go‚Äîblank face‚Äîand watch them fall apart. I should note that I can get away with that passive silence because I‚Äôm a woman, I think. I suspect black men can‚Äôt.

Harris: The funny thing‚Äîto bring it back to the visible vs. invisible dichotomy‚Äîis that when I really do need assistance, it‚Äôs often like I‚Äôm not there. I am 2 feet away, looking directly at you, maybe while holding an item in my hand that I need a different size of, and the salesperson is so obviously avoiding eye contact!

McMillan Cottom: Exactly, Aisha! When you actually try to consume, you‚Äôre not a customer, so you‚Äôre invisible. You can only be visible as a problem. That‚Äôs it exactly.

Demby: So the last few years of covering this stuff has made me a little more on-edge about my night runs. D.C. is a glorious place to run during the few weeks of midseason weather we get. But I remember running on Q Street at night and being worried about my footsteps, coming up fast behind pedestrians‚Äîwhite pedestrians. It‚Äôs one of the reasons, I guess, I love running on the Mall at night. There are fewer people who will jumpily turn around because a black dude is coming up fast at night. And I still try to stay as visible as possible‚Äîrun in the light, while jangling my keys, if I see folks who aren‚Äôt paying attention. (Of course, there are Capitol Police all over the Mall, soooo ‚Ä¶ )

Harris: It‚Äôs those little extra precautions we have to consider, in order to hope that we don‚Äôt get hurt/killed. What they really boil down to is making white people feel safe.

Demby: This has become more pronounced in recent years as I stopped wearing glasses in public. I didn‚Äôt appreciate how much they subtly marked me as ‚Äúmiddle-class‚Äù and nominally less threatening.

Harris: Glasses are HUGE. It‚Äôs like an inverse of the ‚Äúguy/girl is suddenly hot when they take off their glasses‚Äù trope. Black people are suddenly ‚Äúsafer‚Äù with them on.

Harris: OK, last question from me. Is Starbucks‚Äô game plan‚Äîto shut down all of its stores for an afternoon and provide unconscious-bias training to its employees‚Äîa step in the right direction? Could it fundamentally change its role as a ‚Äúthird space‚Äù meant primarily for the comforts of white people?

Advertisement

Demby: I dunno. Whatever they arrive at, the thing about inclusive spaces, about creating and maintaining them, is that they are a lot of work. It‚Äôs a lot of signaling and a lot of being affirmative about what‚Äôs happening in a store at any given moment. Do y‚Äôall think Starbucks is up to that? It‚Äôs frankly going to require a kind of work that baristas don‚Äôt get paid enough to do and training that they probably won‚Äôt get. And given how hard it is to regulate policy across a chain as vast as Starbucks‚Äîthis mess revealed how wildly varied the bathroom-use policy seems to be in their stores from place to place‚Äîit‚Äôs going to be really difficult to make this work in practice. But it might work as PR. At least enough for this to quiet down, anyway.

Bouie: It‚Äôs great PR. But the larger problem, I think, are city governments that facilitate ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù but aren‚Äôt as interested in inclusivity and who turn public space over to the developers and interests who build these spaces for affluent white people.

Harris: I concur. It‚Äôs also not clear if the conscious-bias training will be part of the onboarding process going forward. Starbucks is not a job that everyone works at forever. A new batch of employees will likely start working at some locations just a day after this session is supposed to take place. And then what?

McMillan Cottom: It is a step in the right direction FOR THEIR BRAND. It is totally on-brand. It‚Äôs extra on-brand. From a crisis-management perspective, it is genius. Will it change the experience of black customers at Starbucks? Likely not."

The two black men arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks last week have broken their silence.

On Thursday, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson spoke with the media for the first time since the incident in an interview with ""Good Morning America.""

Nelson and Robinson broke down the timeline of the day they were arrested in a Starbucks location, an incident that went viral after a bystander posted a video online. According to the men, the store manager called 911 mere minutes after they arrived at the store for a business meeting.

Footage of the arrest went viral, sparking outrage and prompting other people of color to share similar stories of exclusion at the coffee giant. Starbucks' CEO, Kevin Johnson, publicly apologized to Robinson and Nelson and has announced plans for the chain to close all locations for an afternoon in May for racial-bias education.

Nelson and Robinson said they hoped the incident served as a ""stepping stone"" to prevent similar situations from happening in the future.

""Take this opportunity as a stepping stone to really stand up and show your greatness,"" Nelson said. ""You are not judged by the color of your skin, as your ancestors were.""

He continued: ""This is something that has been going on for years, but everyone is blind to it.""

Starbucks manager told 911 of 2 men 'refusing to make a purchase or leave' before their arrests

The former Starbucks manager whose telephone call initiated the controversial arrest of two African-American men at her downtown Philadelphia store told 911, ‚ÄúI have two gentlemen at my cafe that are refusing to make a purchase or leave,‚Äù according to the taped audio of the call released by police Tuesday.

Responding to the 4:37 p.m. call last Thursday, the operator said she would send police to the location at 18th and Spruce Streets and, about three minutes later, a radio dispatcher can be heard in the audio saying, ‚Äú1801 Spruce at Starbucks a group of males‚Äù was ‚Äúrefusing to leave.‚Äù

After police arrived, they requested an additional officer and supervisor, according to the audio.

Police then radioed at 5 p.m. that they would be transporting the two arrested men to police headquarters.

The incident has prompted widespread condemnation, protests, an apology from Starbucks‚Äô CEO and a plan to close all the U.S. company-owned stores for an afternoon of racial-bias education. The manager is no longer employed there.

Melissa DePino, whose video of the arrest went viral on social media, told ABC News the men were doing nothing more than sitting at a table when police officers entered the shop, put them in handcuffs and hauled them away.

Starbucks released a statement Tuesday saying all 8,000 of its nationwide company-owned stores will shut down for a few hours May 29 for racial-bias education for about 175,000 employees.

In a supplemental video with the statement, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson, who has zeroed in on ""unconscious bias,"" said the move comes as they are ‚Äúcommitted to being part of the solution,‚Äù and that this training ‚Äúis just one step in a journey that requires dedication from every level of our company and partnerships in our local communities.‚Äù"

He thought nothing of it when he and his childhood friend and business partner, Donte Robinson, were approached at their table and were asked if they needed help. The 23-year-old entrepreneurs declined, explaining they were just waiting for a business meeting.

A few minutes later, they hardly noticed when the police came into the coffee shop - until officers started walking in their direction.

‚ÄúThat's when we knew she called the police on us,‚Äù Nelson told The Associated Press in the first interview by the two black men since video of their trespassing arrests April 12 touched off a furor around the U.S. over racial profiling, or what has been dubbed ‚Äúretail racism‚Äù or ‚Äúshopping while black.‚Äù

Nelson and Robinson were led away in handcuffs from the shop in the city's well-to-do Rittenhouse Square neighborhood in an incident recorded on a white customer's cellphone.

In the week since, the men have met with Starbucks' apologetic CEO and have started pushing for lasting change at the coffee-shop chain, including new policies on discrimination and ejecting customers.

‚ÄúWe do want to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody again,‚Äù Robinson said. ‚ÄúWhat if it wasn't us sitting there? What if it was the kid that didn't know somebody that knew somebody? Do they make it to jail? Do they die? What happens?‚Äù

On Thursday, they also got an apology from Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross, a black man who at first staunchly defended his officers' handling of the incident.

‚ÄúI should have said the officers acted within the scope of the law, and not that they didn't do anything wrong,‚Äù Ross said. ‚ÄúWords are very important.‚Äù

At a news conference, a somber Ross said he ‚Äúfailed miserably‚Äù in addressing the arrests. He said that the issue of race is not lost on him and that he shouldn't be the person making things worse. ‚ÄúShame on me if, in any way, I've done that,‚Äù he said.

He also said the police department did not have a policy for dealing for such situations but does now, and it will be released soon.

Nelson and Robinson said they went to the Starbucks to meet Andrew Yaffe, a white local businessman, over a potential real estate opportunity. Three officers showed up not long after. Nelson said they weren't questioned but were told to leave immediately.

Yaffe showed up as the men were being handcuffed and could be seen in the video demanding an explanation for the officers' actions. Nelson and Robinson did not resist arrest.

‚ÄúWhen you know that you did nothing wrong, how do you really react to it?‚Äù Nelson said. ‚ÄúYou can either be ignorant or you can show some type of sophistication and act like you have class. That was the choice we had.‚Äù

It was not their first encounter with police. But neither had been arrested before, setting them apart from many of those they grew up with in their gritty southwest Philadelphia neighborhood.

Nelson and Robinson spent hours in a jail cell and were released after midnight, when the district attorney declined to prosecute them.

Nelson said he wondered if he'd make it home alive.

‚ÄúAny time I'm encountered by cops, I can honestly say it's a thought that runs through my mind,‚Äù Nelson said. ‚ÄúYou never know what's going to happen.‚Äù

Starbucks has said the coffee shop where the arrests occurred has a policy that restrooms are for paying customers only, but the company has no overall policy. The men's attorney, Stewart Cohen, said they were illegally profiled.

The arrests prompted protests at the Starbucks and a national boycott. Kevin Johnson, CEO of the Seattle-based company, came to Philadelphia to meet with the men, called the arrests ‚Äúreprehensible‚Äù and ordered more than 8,000 Starbucks stores closed on the afternoon of May 29 so that nearly 175,000 employees can receive training on unconscious bias.

Robinson said that he appreciates the public support but that anger and boycotting Starbucks are not the solution.

The men said they are looking for more lasting results and are in mediation with Starbucks to make changes, including the posting in stores of a customer bill of rights; the adoption of new policies on customer ejections and racial discrimination; and independent investigations of complaints.

‚ÄúYou go from being someone who's just trying to be an entrepreneur, having your own dreams and aspirations, and then this happens,‚Äù Nelson said. ‚ÄúHow do you handle it? Do you stand up? Do you fight? Do you sit down and just watch everyone else fight for you? Do you let it slide, like we let everything else slide with injustice?‚Äù"

Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, along with their attorney, Stewart Cohen, spoke with GMA‚Äôs Robin Roberts to describe their encounter with the white Starbucks manager who called 911 on them, as well as with the police who arrived soon afterward. Starbucks executives, including the company‚Äôs executive chairman, Howard Schultz, and its chief executive, Kevin Johnson, have met with the men to personally apologize and have appeared in television interviews in the wake of protests outside the Philadelphia location.

But Thursday was the first time Nelson and Robinson publicly told their story. It was also the first time Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross took to a podium to significantly walk back comments from over the weekend in which he said the officers ‚Äúdid absolutely nothing wrong.‚Äù Ross personally apologized and said that if he had done anything to worsen race relations, ‚Äúshame on me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to make sure this situation doesn‚Äôt happen again,‚Äù Robinson, 23, said. ‚ÄúWhat I want is for a young man or young men to not be traumatized by this; and instead, motivated and inspired.‚Äù

The men said they arrived at the Center City Starbucks at 4:35 p.m. for a 4:45 business meeting. Immediately upon walking in, Nelson asked the manager if he could use the restroom. The manager said the restrooms were for paying customers only.

‚ÄúAnd I just left it at that,‚Äù Nelson, 23, said.

Robinson said that after Nelson got back to the table, the manager came over to their table to ask if she could help with any drinks or water. Robinson said they had water bottles with them and were waiting for a meeting.

At 4:37 ‚Äî two minutes after the men arrived ‚Äî the manager called the police to report that ‚Äútwo gentlemen in my cafe that are refusing to make a purchase or leave.‚Äù Officers arrived at 4:41, according to tapes released by the Philadelphia police this week.

Robinson said that when he saw police arrive, he thought, ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt be here for us.‚Äù

Nelson said the police told him and Robinson they had to leave without any discussion about what was happening between them and the manager. Then they were arrested. Robinson said they weren‚Äôt read any rights or told why they were being arrested.

The charges ‚Äî trespassing and creating a disturbance ‚Äî were dropped that night.

Cohen, who appeared in the segment alongside Nelson and Robinson, said that from the video of the men‚Äôs arrest, ‚Äúthe facts speak for themselves.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a single witness that says that these men were misbehaving, and you can see and hear that in the video,‚Äù Cohen said.

Robinson said that during his arrest, he thought about his family and community and that he was ‚Äújust trying to process the situation.‚Äù

Nelson told the Associated Press that he feared for his life.

‚ÄúAnytime I‚Äôm encountered by cops, I can honestly say it‚Äôs a thought that runs through my mind,‚Äù Nelson said. ‚ÄúYou never know what‚Äôs going to happen.‚Äù

Roberts asked Robinson about Starbucks‚Äôs policy that restricts nonpaying customers from using the restroom or sitting in the store, as well as the fact that the police told him and Nelson to leave.

‚ÄúI understand that rules are rules, but what‚Äôs right is right, and what‚Äôs wrong is wrong,‚Äù Robinson said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs in any situation, whether there‚Äôs race involved or anything.‚Äù

A Starbucks spokesperson, Jaime Riley, told The Washington Post on Wednesday that ‚Äúin this particular store, the guidelines were that partners must ask unpaying customers to leave the store, and police were to be called if they refused.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn this situation,‚Äù Riley said, ‚Äúthe police should never have been called. And we know we have to review the practices and guidelines to help ensure it never happens again.‚Äù

Cohen said he and his clients suggested that along with Starbucks, they engage in a mediation with a retired federal judge in Philadelphia. Cohen said Starbucks agreed to that proposal, which necessitates that the conversations between executives and Nelson and Robinson remain confidential.

The AP reported that the men are in mediation proceedings with Starbucks to implement changes like the posting of a customer bill of rights in stores; new policies regarding customer ejections and racial profiling; and independent investigations of complaints of profiling or discrimination from customers and employees.

Nelson said he hoped his experience could be used as a ‚Äústeppingstone‚Äù to future progress.

‚ÄúEveryone is blind to it, but they know what‚Äôs going on,‚Äù Nelson said. ‚ÄúJust really taking those actions and putting them into place. And helping people understand this is not just a black people thing; this is a people thing.‚Äù

Nelson and Robinson have been best friends since the fourth grade, they told the AP. Robinson has been a customer at the Starbucks in Rittenhouse Square since he was 15, the AP reported.

At a news conference Thursday, Ross offered a series of apologies to Nelson, Robinson and the community, days after he announced in a Facebook Live video over the weekend that the officers followed policy, were professional and ‚Äúdid absolutely nothing wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúI should have said the officers acted within the scope of the law, and not that they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong,‚Äù Ross said. ‚ÄúWords are very important.‚Äù

Ross said he genuinely did not know that it was common practice for people to sit in a Starbucks without making any purchases, and that it‚Äôs possible the officers who made the arrests didn‚Äôt know either. Now that he knows, Ross said he understands why Nelson and Robinson ‚Äúwere appalled when they were asked to leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor this reason, me, I apologize,‚Äù Ross said.

Ross said his department has already completed a new policy to guide officers on how to deal with similar situations, noting that no such policy existed before ‚Äúbecause it is nearly impossible to have a policy for every criminal or any other violation.‚Äù He did not give specifics behind that policy, saying they would be provided ‚Äúat a later date.‚Äù

He also noted that the officers originally dispatched to the Starbucks were trying to prevent anyone from getting hurt, which is why they requested backup.

‚ÄúThe intent was not to intimidate, it was actually to do something different,‚Äù Ross said.

Ross said that issues surrounding race were not lost on him, nor were ‚Äúthe optics.‚Äù

‚ÄúMessaging is important and I failed miserably in this regard,‚Äù Ross said. ‚ÄúI am flawed like many others folks, but that is still no excuse. We will continue to acknowledge how race plays a factor and role in many things that we do.‚Äù

On Wednesday, Howard Schultz told Gayle King of ‚ÄúCBS This Morning‚Äù that he had met with the manager and that she ‚Äúrecognizes that perhaps that call should not have been made.‚Äù When the manager called the police, Schultz said, she probably thought they would come to her location and talk to the men about what they were doing inside.

‚ÄúI think you have to say in looking at the tape that she demonstrated her own level of unconscious bias,‚Äù Schultz told King. ‚ÄúAnd in looking at the tape, you ask yourself whether or not that in fact was racial profiling.‚Äù

Also on Wednesday morning, Kevin Johnson appeared on Fox Business Network‚Äôs ‚ÄúMornings With Maria‚Äù and talked about meeting with the men who were arrested.

‚ÄúI had the opportunity to apologize to those two gentlemen for what happened to them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt deserve that.‚Äù Johnson also met with Philadelphia‚Äôs mayor, the police commissioner and other community leaders. On Wednesday, Johnson and Schultz met with about 40 local clergy and lay leaders.

On Tuesday, Starbucks announced that it would close 8,000 U.S. stores for an afternoon next month for racial-bias training for 175,000 employees. That announcement came after days of protests at the Philadelphia Starbucks and a personal apology from Johnson."

PHILADELPHIA -- Rashon Nelson initially brushed it off when the Starbucks manager told him he couldn't use the restroom because he wasn't a paying customer. He thought nothing of it when he and his business partner, Donte Robinson, were approached at their table and were asked if they needed help. The 23-year-old entrepreneurs declined, explaining they were just waiting for a business meeting.

A few minutes later, they hardly noticed when the police walked into the coffee shop -- until officers started walking in their direction.

""That's when we knew she called the police on us,"" Nelson told The Associated Press in the men's first interview since video of their April 12 arrests went viral.

Nelson and Robinson, black men who became best friends in the fourth grade, were taken in handcuffs from the Starbucks in Philadelphia's tony Rittenhouse Square neighborhood, where Robinson has been a customer since he was 15.

The video, recorded on a white customer's cellphone video, galvanized people around the country who saw the exchange as modern-day racism. In the week since, the men have met with Starbucks' CEO and have started pushing for lasting changes to ensure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else.

""We were there for a real reason, a real deal that we were working on,"" Robinson explained. ""We put in a lot of time, energy, effort. ... We were at a moment that could have a positive impact on a whole ladder of people, lives, families. So I was like, 'No, you're not stopping that right now.'""

Robinson said he thought about his loved ones and how the afternoon had taken such a turn as he was taken to jail. Nelson wondered if he'd make it home alive.

""Anytime I'm encountered by cops, I can honestly say it's a thought that runs through my mind,"" Nelson said. ""You never know what's going to happen.""

""CBS This Morning"" co-host Gayle King sat down with Starbucks' executive chairman Howard Schultz on Wednesday to discuss how the company is handling the incident.

""I'm embarrassed, ashamed. I think what occurred was reprehensible at every single level. I think I take it very personally as everyone in our company does and we're committed to making it right. The announcement we made yesterday about closing our stores, 8,000 stores closed, to do significant training with our people is just the beginning of what we will do to transform the way we do business and educate our people on unconscious bias,"" Schultz said.

Democratic Mayor Jim Kenney, who is white, said what happened at the Starbucks ""appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018."" Police Commissioner Richard Ross, who's black, said in a Facebook post that arresting officers ""did absolutely nothing wrong,"" and added that Nelson and Robinson were disrespectful to officers.

Ross said officers did what they were supposed to do and were professional in their dealings with the men, ""and instead they got the opposite back.""

Nelson and Robinson originally were supposed to meet Andrew Yaffe, a white local businessman, at a Starbucks across town. But the plan changed, and they agreed to meet at the Rittenhouse Square location, where they'd met several times before on a potential real estate opportunity.

The black men arrived a few minutes early. Three police officers showed up not long after.

Nelson said they weren't questioned but were told to leave immediately.

Yaffe showed up as the men were being handcuffed. He can be seen in the video demanding an explanation for the officers' actions. Nelson and Robinson did not resist arrest, confused and unsure of what to think or what might happen next.

""When you know that you did nothing wrong, how do you really react to it?"" Nelson said. ""You can either be ignorant or you can show some type of sophistication and act like you have class. That was the choice we had.""

It was hardly their first encounter with police, a rite of passage that becomes a regular occurrence for many black men their age. But neither had been arrested before, setting them apart from many of their peers in the gritty southwest Philadelphia neighborhood where they grew up.

Robinson briefly wondered what he might've done to bring the moment on himself.

""I feel like I fell short,"" he explained. ""I'm trying to think of something I did wrong, to put not just me but my brother, my lifelong friend ... in this situation.""

Attorney Stewart Cohen, representing Nelson and Robinson, said the men were illegally profiled. He pointed to Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race in hotels, restaurants, theaters and other public accommodations.

Seattle-based Starbucks Corp. has said the location where the arrests occurred has a policy that restrooms are for paying customers only.

In audio recordings released by police Wednesday, the employee who called 911 can be heard telling the operator, ""I have two gentlemen in my cafe that are refusing to make a purchase or leave."" In a subsequent communication between police and dispatch, someone says ""we have a disturbance at the Starbucks"" and refers to ""a group of males inside causing a disturbance,"" and additional officers are sent. The Starbucks employee never called it a disturbance.

Nelson and Robinson spent hours in a jail cell with no outside contact and no sense of what would happen next. They were released after midnight, when the district attorney declined to prosecute them for trespassing. They had no idea the video of their arrests was making the rounds on the internet.

The day after their arrests, they thought about what to do next.

""You go from being someone who's just trying to be an entrepreneur, having your own dreams and aspirations, and then this happens,"" Nelson said. ""How do you handle it? Do you stand up? Do you fight? Do you sit down and just watch everyone else fight for you? Do you let it slide, like we let everything else slide with injustice?""

Robinson, still focused on the previous day's business deal, called Yaffe to reschedule. Yaffe told him about the video and the traction it had gotten.

Over the weekend, attention and outrage over the video grew, prompting a protest at the local Starbucks restaurant and a national boycott. By Monday, the men were set to meet with Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson to discuss what happened.

Johnson has responded quickly to public outcry around the arrests, calling them ""reprehensible,"" apologizing and ordering stores closed for mandatory training to tackle unconscious bias.

Nelson and Robinson said they're looking for more lasting results and are in mediation proceedings with Starbucks to implement changes, including the posting in stores of a customer bill of rights; the adoption of new policies regarding customer ejections, racial profiling and racial discrimination; and independent investigations of complaints of profiling or discrimination from customers and employees.

Robinson said he appreciates the public support the men have received but anger and boycotting Starbucks are not the solution.

""We need a different type of action ... not words,"" he said. ""It's a time to pay attention and understand what's really going on. We do want a seat at the table."""

The video, recorded on a white customer‚Äôs cellphone video, galvanized people around the country who saw the exchange as modern-day racism. In the week since, the men have met with Starbucks‚Äô CEO and have started pushing for lasting changes to ensure what happened to them doesn‚Äôt happen to anyone else.

@Starbucks The police were called because these men hadn‚Äôt ordered anything. They were waiting for a friend to show up, who did as they were taken out in handcuffs for doing nothing. All the other white ppl are wondering why it‚Äôs never happened to us when we do the same thing. pic.twitter.com/0U4Pzs55Ci ‚Äî Melissa DePino (@missydepino) April 12, 2018

‚ÄúWe were there for a real reason, a real deal that we were working on,‚Äù Robinson explained. ‚ÄúWe put in a lot of time, energy, effort. ‚Ä¶ We were at a moment that could have a positive impact on a whole ladder of people, lives, families. So I was like, ‚ÄòNo, you‚Äôre not stopping that right now.'‚Äù

Robinson said he thought about his loved ones and how the afternoon had taken such a turn as he was taken to jail. Nelson wondered if he‚Äôd make it home alive.

‚ÄúAnytime I‚Äôm encountered by cops, I can honestly say it‚Äôs a thought that runs through my mind,‚Äù Nelson said. ‚ÄúYou never know what‚Äôs going to happen.‚Äù

Democratic Mayor Jim Kenney, who is white, said what happened at the Starbucks ‚Äúappears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018.‚Äù Police Commissioner Richard Ross, who‚Äôs black, said in a Facebook post that arresting officers ‚Äúdid absolutely nothing wrong,‚Äù and added that Nelson and Robinson were disrespectful to officers.

Ross said officers did what they were supposed to do and were professional in their dealings with the men, ‚Äúand instead they got the opposite back.‚Äù

Nelson and Robinson originally were supposed to meet Andrew Yaffe, a white local businessman, at a Starbucks across town. But the plan changed, and they agreed to meet at the Rittenhouse Square location, where they‚Äôd met several times before on a potential real estate opportunity.

The black men arrived a few minutes early. Three police officers showed up not long after.

Nelson said they weren‚Äôt questioned but were told to leave immediately.

Yaffe showed up as the men were being handcuffed. He can be seen in the video demanding an explanation for the officers‚Äô actions. Nelson and Robinson did not resist arrest, confused and unsure of what to think or what might happen next.

‚ÄúWhen you know that you did nothing wrong, how do you really react to it?‚Äù Nelson said. ‚ÄúYou can either be ignorant or you can show some type of sophistication and act like you have class. That was the choice we had.‚Äù

It was hardly their first encounter with police, a rite of passage that becomes a regular occurrence for many black men their age. But neither had been arrested before, setting them apart from many of their peers in the gritty southwest Philadelphia neighborhood where they grew up.

Robinson briefly wondered what he might‚Äôve done to bring the moment on himself.

‚ÄúI feel like I fell short,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to think of something I did wrong, to put not just me but my brother, my lifelong friend ‚Ä¶ in this situation.‚Äù

Attorney Stewart Cohen, representing Nelson and Robinson, said the men were illegally profiled. He pointed to Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race in hotels, restaurants, theaters and other public accommodations.

Seattle-based Starbucks Corp. has said the location where the arrests occurred has a policy that restrooms are for paying customers only.

Nelson and Robinson spent hours in a jail cell with no outside contact and no sense of what would happen next. They were released after midnight, when the district attorney declined to prosecute them for trespassing. They had no idea the video of their arrests was making the rounds on the internet.

The day after their arrests, they thought about what to do next.

‚ÄúYou go from being someone who‚Äôs just trying to be an entrepreneur, having your own dreams and aspirations, and then this happens,‚Äù Nelson said. ‚ÄúHow do you handle it? Do you stand up? Do you fight? Do you sit down and just watch everyone else fight for you? Do you let it slide, like we let everything else slide with injustice?‚Äù

Robinson, still focused on the previous day‚Äôs business deal, called Yaffe to reschedule. Yaffe told him about the video and the traction it had gotten.

Over the weekend, attention and outrage over the video grew, prompting a protest at the local Starbucks restaurant and a national boycott. By Monday, the men were set to meet with Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson to discuss what happened.

Johnson has responded quickly to public outcry around the arrests, calling them ‚Äúreprehensible,‚Äù apologizing and ordering stores closed for mandatory training to tackle unconscious bias.

Nelson and Robinson said they‚Äôre looking for more lasting results and are in mediation proceedings with Starbucks to implement changes, including the posting in stores of a customer bill of rights; the adoption of new policies regarding customer ejections, racial profiling and racial discrimination; and independent investigations of complaints of profiling or discrimination from customers and employees.

Robinson said he appreciates the public support the men have received but anger and boycotting Starbucks are not the solution.

‚ÄúWe need a different type of action ‚Ä¶ not words,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a time to pay attention and understand what‚Äôs really going on. We do want a seat at the table.‚Äù

""We need a different type of action ... not words,"" Donte Robinson said in an interview with the Associated Press. ""It's time to pay attention and understand what's really going on. We do want a seat at the table.""

Robinson and his business partner, Rashon Nelson, were arrested shortly after they declined a request for service, explaining they were waiting for a business meeting. They had arrived a few minutes early for the meeting with Andrew Yaffe, a white local businessman, who can seen in a video recording of the event demanding an explanation for the police officers' actions.

Nelson and Robinson told the Associated Press they spent hours in jail with no outside contact and no idea the video of their arrests had gone viral.

Nelson said he had questioned whether he would return home alive. ""Anytime I'm encountered by the cops, I can honestly say it's a thought that runs through my mind,"" Nelson said. ""You never know what's going to happen.""

Sitting in a jail cell, the 23-year-old entrepreneurs thought about their next step. ""Do you let it slide, like we let everything else slide with injustice,"" Nelson asked? Robinson continued to focus on the previous day's business deal and called Yaffe to reschedule the meeting.

Nelson and Robinson were later released because of a lack of evidence that a crime had been committed.



Starbucks said Tuesday it will close all of its more than 8,000 company-owned U.S. stores on May 29 to educate employees about racial bias, in an attempt to prevent more acts of discrimination.

""I've spent the past few days in Philadelphia with my leadership team listening to the community, learning what we did wrong and the steps we need to take to fix it,"" said CEO Kevin Johnson. ""Closing our stores for racial bias training is just one step in a journey that requires dedication from every level of our company and partnerships in our local communities.""

The coffeehouse chain, which is also closing its corporate offices on May 29, said a curriculum is being developed for its 175,000 employees, with assistance from several racial bias training experts. They include Equal Justice Initiative executive director Bryan Stevenson, NAACP Legal Defense Education Fund President Sherrilyn Ifill and former attorney general Eric Holder.

Starbucks said the employee who called police on the men no longer worked at that location.

Johnson, who has met with the men, called the arrests ""reprehensible."""

AP National Writer

PHILADELPHIA (AP) ‚Äî Rashon Nelson initially brushed it off when the Starbucks manager told him he couldn't use the restroom because he wasn't a paying customer.

He thought nothing of it when he and his childhood friend and business partner, Donte Robinson, were approached at their table and were asked if they needed help. The 23-year-old entrepreneurs declined, explaining they were just waiting for a business meeting.

A few minutes later, they hardly noticed when the police came into the coffee shop ‚Äî until officers started walking in their direction.

""That's when we knew she called the police on us,"" Nelson told The Associated Press in the first interview by the two black men since video of their April 12 trespassing arrests touched off a furor around the U.S. over racial profiling or what has been dubbed ""retail racism"" or ""shopping while black.""

Nelson and Robinson were led away in handcuffs from the shop in the city's well-to-do Rittenhouse Square neighborhood in an incident recorded on a white customer's cellphone.

In the week since, the men have met with Starbucks' apologetic CEO and have started pushing for lasting change at the coffee shop chain, including new policies on discrimination and ejecting customers.

""We do want to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody again,"" Robinson said. ""What if it wasn't us sitting there? What if it was the kid that didn't know somebody that knew somebody? Do they make it to jail? Do they die? What happens?""

On Thursday, they also got an apology from Philadelphia police Commissioner Richard Ross, a black man who at first staunchly defended his officers' handling of the encounter.

""I should have said the officers acted within the scope of the law, and not that they didn't do anything wrong,"" Ross said. ""Words are very important.""

At a news conference, a somber Ross said he ""failed miserably"" in addressing the arrests. He said that the issue of race is not lost on him and that he shouldn't be the person making things worse.

""Shame on me if, in any way, I've done that,"" he said.

He also said the police department did not have a policy for dealing for such situations but does now and it will be released soon.

Nelson and Robinson said they went to the Starbucks to meet Andrew Yaffe, a white local businessman, over a potential real estate opportunity. Three officers showed up not long after. Nelson said they weren't questioned but were told to leave immediately.

Yaffe showed up as the men were being handcuffed and could be seen in the video demanding an explanation for the officers' actions. Nelson and Robinson did not resist arrest.

""When you know that you did nothing wrong, how do you really react to it?"" Nelson said. ""You can either be ignorant or you can show some type of sophistication and act like you have class. That was the choice we had.""

It was not their first encounter with police. But neither had been arrested before, setting them apart from many of those they grew up with in their gritty southwest Philadelphia neighborhood.

Starbucks has said the coffee shop where the arrests occurred has a policy that restrooms are for paying customers only, but the company has no overall policy. The men's attorney, Stewart Cohen, said they were illegally profiled.

The arrests prompted protests at the Starbucks and a national boycott. Kevin Johnson, CEO of the Seattle-based company, came to Philadelphia to meet with the men, called the arrests ""reprehensible"" and ordered more than 8,000 Starbucks stores closed on the afternoon of May 29 so that nearly 175,000 employees can receive training on unconscious bias. Starbucks has not identified the employee who called police.

Robinson said that he appreciates the public support but that anger and boycotting Starbucks are not the solution.

The two men came to the store for a business meeting. While waiting for the person they planned to meet, one of the men asked to use the restroom and was told that it was only for paying customers. The two men were then approached by the store manager and asked if they wanted to order drinks. After they declined, the manager called 911 and the men were arrested by Philadelphia police for trespassing.

The arrests prompted accusations of racial discrimination, with protestors noting that Starbucks bills its coffee shops as gathering spaces where people often work or socialize without buying anything. Starbucks apologized to the two men and plans to close its more than 8,000 U.S. stores on May 29 to conduct racial bias and diversity training for employees.

Starbucks would be wrong to limit its response only to managing the fallout from the arrests ‚Äî and other brands should also consider what happened to be a wake-up call, according to experts from Wharton and elsewhere.

‚ÄúSadly, I wasn‚Äôt surprised,‚Äù said Wharton management professor Stephanie Creary. ‚ÄúWe have heard recently in the news lots of different incidents like this happening all over the country where individuals, particularly young black men, have been stopped and have been profiled in some way and have subsequently been arrested.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is racism right on its face,‚Äù added Henry C. Boyd, a clinical professor in the marketing department at the University of Maryland. ‚ÄúWhen you think of the [Starbucks] brand, it‚Äôs supposed to be the place between home and office in a way that feels like you‚Äôre at someone‚Äôs house and someone‚Äôs living room. So why the differential treatment?‚Äù

Mary Gilly, senior associate dean and marketing professor at the University of California at Irvine, said the incident was inconsistent with her research on how customers are treated in places like Starbucks. ‚ÄúManagers were very reluctant to ever ask patrons to leave even if they had already finished consuming products or not even consumed at all, even when it was crowded and other customers who wanted a seat and couldn‚Äôt find one complained to them,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWhen you think of the [Starbucks] brand, it‚Äôs supposed to be the place ‚Ä¶ that feels like you‚Äôre at someone‚Äôs house and someone‚Äôs living room. So why the differential treatment?‚Äù‚ÄìHenry C. Boyd

Creary, Boyd and Gilly discussed the implications of the Starbucks case on the Knowledge at Wharton show on SiriusXM channel 111. (Listen to the full podcast using the player at the top of the page.)

The Gold Standard of Crisis Management

Starbucks‚Äô response to the customers‚Äô arrest in Philadelphia, including the decision to close its stores for racial-bias education, ‚Äúis a forceful statement about the gravity of the incident,‚Äù said Wharton management professor Michael Useem, who is also director of the school‚Äôs Center for Leadership and Change Management. ‚ÄúIt is a powerful first step in bolstering a culture of diversity and fairness in all of its stores.‚Äù

Wharton marketing professor Americus Reed cited three best practices for managing brand crises such as the one facing Starbucks. ‚ÄúNumber one, you have to validate concerns,‚Äù he said, stressing the need to display empathy and regret even as the company may go about verifying the facts of the case.

The second principle is to ‚Äúshow action,‚Äù Reed said, and complimented Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson on engaging in ‚Äúa conversation to spur on a more socially responsive movement, and to elevate the conversation.‚Äù The third principle is to ‚Äúcontrol the narrative.‚Äù

‚ÄúStarbucks in this particular instance did a nice job of hitting on those three principles, [which are] the gold standard for crisis management,‚Äù said Reed.

Boyd agreed that Johnson made a strong statement with actions such as meeting with the two men who were arrested, offering an unconditional apology and seeking the help of community leaders in reshaping the company‚Äôs future policies.

‚ÄúStarbucks in this particular instance did a nice job of hitting on those three principles, [which are] the gold standard for crisis management.‚Äù‚ÄìAmericus Reed

More Action Is Needed

However, Boyd said that even as Starbucks is ‚Äútaking the right steps [in] corrective action, they‚Äôre going to have to do more.‚Äù He called for the company to license or turn over management of more stores to black owners and managers if it wants to demonstrate that it genuinely wants to be inclusive. The choice of locations for such stores run by black owners and managers also matters, he said, including in areas with upper-middle class African American communities and other places with strong business potential.

Creary agreed that while what the company is doing in terms of corrective action is ‚Äùcommendable,‚Äù more needs to be done. She also noted a changed nuance in how the company has approached the issue of training. ‚ÄúThey were first calling it unconscious bias training. I‚Äôm very happy to know that they‚Äôre now calling it some sort of racial bias training and diversity training, more broadly.‚Äù

Gilly called for ‚Äúa longer-term commitment‚Äù to diversity in not just licensing of Starbucks stores, but also in hiring. She wondered if the presence of a black employee at the location in question would have helped straighten out matters and prevented the matter from escalating into an arrest. Creary was not so sure if a black employee at the location would have changed the situation. ‚ÄúThe reality is there was a challenge with that particular manager and the practices that they have in place there,‚Äù she said.

Creary noted that the way the two men were treated went contrary to Starbucks‚Äô stated value system. ‚ÄúThe reality is they need to make closer and tighter links between the company values [and] creating a culture of belonging for customers.‚Äù

Lessons for All

Gilly said the Starbucks incident holds lessons for companies across the board. ‚ÄúAny company that is open to the public ‚Ä¶ needs to think about this and how they treat customers,‚Äù she added. She cited comments from her students who complained of being ignored at a Neiman Marcus or Nordstrom‚Äôs store if they went in wearing jeans and a sweatshirt, and yet, ‚Äúwhen I go from work [in office attire], they‚Äôre fawning all over me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey were first calling it unconscious bias training. I‚Äôm very happy to know that they‚Äôre now calling it some sort of racial bias training and diversity training, more broadly.‚Äù‚ÄìStephanie Creary

Boyd said he didn‚Äôt expect any quick fixes to emerge from Starbucks‚Äô response. ‚ÄúA training program may have some lasting effects, but then it wears off,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to take a while to move the needle on this particular topic.‚Äù Corporations have to be consciously aware of inherent biases, and consistently work on purging them, he added.

For example, before making a call to the police, Boyd said an employee should ask him or herself: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs triggering it? Is it really that these guys are being disruptive? Or is there some bad seed in my mind saying, ‚ÄòOh yeah, it‚Äôs the black guy, he‚Äôs going to commit this crime.‚Äô If you can be cognizant of it and then turn that off, then it will be a more positive step going forward.‚Äù

The costs of inaction will likely be heavy in an age when social media is pervasive. Boyd noted the role of the video that another customer took of the arrests and how its going viral triggered the wider debate on race relations. ‚ÄúWe are now very aware of what‚Äôs going on in society thanks to these devices, thanks to technology,‚Äù he said, adding that companies need to be aware that their conduct is being constantly watched, and ensure that it is consistent with their value systems.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm wildly optimistic that we‚Äôre going to get there. Each day we‚Äôre taking another step closer and closer to that more perfect union,‚Äù Boyd said.

Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, the arrests of two African-American men at a Philadelphia Starbucks for trespassing when they opted not to order anything has catapulted the issue of racial bias into the national spotlight.

Again.

That it happened at a store designed as a place to hang out makes it all the more poignant. It was a location where people do those most human of actions ‚Äî eating and drinking. Despite the universality of restaurants, bars and yes, coffee shops, as age-old vehicles to socialize, they are also mangled by centuries of racism.

Long after slavery was abolished, the black-white dynamic around food service cast minorities as cooks and servers and whites as diners in private homes as well as restaurants. As recently as the 1960s, lunch counter sit-ins highlighted black discrimination in the area of food once more.

""It's clear that what transpired at Starbucks is a vestige of our segregated past,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, one of the country's leading think tanks. ""We act like MLK 50 years ago was centuries ago. No. We‚Äôre still struggling with companies that do not value black people, and we should take this moment of all these anniversaries to take stock and see how far have we come.

""I think the Starbucks incident says we still have a far way to go.""

The April 12 incident inspired protests, calls for a boycott of Starbucks, an apology from CEO Kevin Johnson and racial-bias training for all employees at company-owned U.S. stores and the corporate offices.

And something else.

The mockery of African Americans came in the form of a bogus coupon for free coffee for blacks only, created and promoted on social media Wednesday by Internet trolls, possibly with ties to the resurgent white-supremacy movement. Those who fell for the prank were led to a website with the N-word.

The drumbeat of incidents of prejudice and racial profiling as it relates to dining defies the nation's progress on other fronts.

""However intimate we feel eating is and breaking bread with other people is, for the entire history of this country and western society and other societies, who we do or do not eat with says a lot about what we think about people,"" said Ijeoma Oluo, the author of So You Want to Talk About Race.

Last month, a Maine IHOP asked black diners to pay in advance for their food. A Portland, Ore., chef got into trouble for Instagramming a photo of fried chicken to mark the 50th anniversary of King‚Äôs assassination.

In February, Applebee‚Äôs was lambasted after staff at a Missouri location falsely accused two African-American women of dining and dashing without paying. New York University and Chicago‚Äôs Loyola University were criticized for advertising Black History Month-themed menus that featured stereotypically African-American foods.

And that‚Äôs just the first four months of this year.

Two years ago, a Joe‚Äôs Crab Shack in Minnesota was caught using a photo of a black man‚Äôs lynching as part of a table decoration. In 2004, Cracker Barrel settled a lawsuit accusing the chain of discriminating against African-American customers and workers in 16 states, including instituting segregated seating and denying them service. A decade before that, Denny‚Äôs agreed to pay $54 million in a class action for treating thousands of black customers badly.

""It doesn't surprise me it happens; it surprises me that it makes news at all,"" Oluo said. ""Sometimes, we sit and wait and wait and wait and we see everyone around us get served and we think, ‚ÄúOh, please don‚Äôt let this be what I think it is.'‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think there's anyone over age 6 who'd be surprised to hear this ‚Äî or didn't have a story of their own.""

Nor is restaurant racism limited to fast-food and family eateries, both of which are more casual types of dining where people from many races, religions, ages and socioeconomic strata converge.

Half the waiters at full-service restaurants admitted that their treatment of customers depended on those diners' races, according to research by Wayne State University associate sociology professor Zachary Brewster. That's due to false preconceived notions that African Americans are bad tippers or more demanding customers.

""They use this justification to devalue black customers,"" he said. ""In most cases, it‚Äôs de-prioritizing service. Hypothetically, if two tables need their drinks refilled, I suspect discrimination would take the form of attending to the needs of the white table first.""

To avoid overt racism, African Americans used to turn to The Negro Motorist Green Book, which listed restaurants, hotels and gas stations that welcomed black motorists, especially in the segregated South. In the 1930s, mail carrier Victor Hugo Green began to compile that information from his fellow postal workers who knew the establishments on their routes. The indispensable volume was published for more than three decades.

Back then, insisting on staying at an inhospitable eatery could be a fatal mistake for black travelers. Nowadays, it's Starbucks that made the gross misstep, but its penalty is likely to be only a dip in market share, perhaps temporary, and a spate of bad publicity. Perry predicted the chain's competitors ""will do their best to leverage a mistake.""

He points out that 44% of Millennials are people of color. ""For most of America's history, you could ignore or shun the buying power of blacks, Latinos and Asians. You can‚Äôt do that anymore.""

To remedy that, Oluo wants employee training to identify unconscious racism in themselves and how to battle it, clear company disciplinary policies for employees who offer unequal service to minorities and corporate cultures that embrace all customers.

""People think if you teach 'treat all customers nicely,' it‚Äôs enough. It‚Äôs not. People say, 'I treat everyone equally,' No, you think you treat everyone equally,"" she said. ""We‚Äôre not arguing whether or not there's bias. There is. It‚Äôs non-negotiable.""

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/21/starbucks-racial-bias-training-black-men-arrested,"Starbucks needs more than racial bias training after men's arrest, experts say",21/04/2018,https://www.theguardian.com,"Days after two black men were arrested at a Starbucks store in Philadelphia, the company announced a drastic response.



At the end of May, Starbucks stores across the US will close en masse and 175,000 employees will undergo racial bias training, a programme developed by progressive equality organizations.

Starbucks is seen as one of the more progressive US employers and has been praised for the measure. But experts warn that real change will take much more than a one-off training session.

‚ÄúJust doing training is not enough,‚Äù said Holly Hutchins, associate professor of human resource development at the University of Houston‚Äôs College of Technology. ‚ÄúOrganizations tend to rush to the training option as a way to quickly window-dress issues, especially around gender or racial bias.‚Äù

Of all the options available for educating the workforce, Hutchins said diversity training ‚Äúactually has the least impact‚Äù.

‚ÄúPeople are feeling like they‚Äôre going to be strong-armed into changing their beliefs and perspectives about something, and it can often trigger even more stereotypes and backlash,‚Äù she said.

Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson were arrested in Philadelphia on 12 April. The men, both 23, were sitting at a table waiting for a business meeting and had yet to order a drink. A manager called the police and Nelson and Robinson were handcuffed and led from the store.

It is very important that we take this opportunity to go as deep as we possibly can Heather McGhee, Demos

In an interview with the Associated Press, Nelson and Robinson said they had feared for their lives. Video footage recorded by a customer went viral.

Heather McGhee, president of Demos, an equal rights thinktank, will develop the Starbucks training plan with the former US attorney general Eric Holder and representatives of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education fund, the Equal Justice Initiative and the Anti-Defamation League.

McGhee said she was not surprised by what happened to Nelson and Robinson.

‚ÄúIt called to mind some of my earliest memories as an African American of feeling unwelcome and being discriminated against in stores and restaurants and movie theaters,‚Äù McGhee said. ‚ÄúThis is ‚Äì more than most people who are not black know ‚Äì a regular part of the considerations we have when moving through public and private spaces in America.‚Äù

McGhee said that while the closure of stores and the implementation of racial bias training was an eye-catching step, it would serve ‚Äúreally as an introduction‚Äù. It was important that Starbucks carried on the work, she said, including encouraging ‚Äúinterpersonal interactions‚Äù among employees of different races and backgrounds.

‚ÄúIt is very important that we take this opportunity to go as deep as we possibly can,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTo review the policies and procedures, to have a longer-term engagement with Starbucks management about these issues on a deeper level.‚Äù

That means looking at specific rules employees were given, McGhee said, down to making it clear what the standards were for people waiting in stores and what the rules were regarding people using the bathroom. Nelson said he asked to use the bathroom and was refused before the Starbucks manager called the police.

I hope that in addition to training, Starbucks looks at making systemic and structural changes Joelle Emerson, Paradigm

Starbucks has a reputation as one of America‚Äôs better employers. The company offers free university tuition for the duration of an employee‚Äôs degree, in a partnership with Arizona State University. Those working 20 hours a week or more are eligible for health insurance.

Starbucks‚Äô chief executive, Kevin Johnson, said after the incident the company was ‚Äúcommitted to being part of the solution‚Äù regarding racial bias. McGhee said Starbucks‚Äô response at least showed it was prepared to try to improve.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs encouraging that because of the public pressure, because of the activists on the ground, and because of where Starbucks wants to be as a company, they took a higher road,‚Äù she said.

Joelle Emerson, chief executive of Paradigm, a company that works with businesses to improve inclusivity and equality, agreed that Starbucks needed to examine procedures employees were told to follow.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt train bias out of people,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI hope that in addition to training, Starbucks looks at making systemic and structural changes to address what‚Äôs fundamentally a systemic and structural problem stemming from our country‚Äôs history of racism.

‚ÄúProcesses and policies that guide employees‚Äô actions are an important complement to training and can go a long way towards reducing the influence of bias.‚Äù

Hutchins said it would also be key for Starbucks to make sure teams that work together or go through training together come from a mix of backgrounds.

‚ÄúWhere you get a diverse array of individuals on a team you get individuals who have different perspectives,‚Äù she said.

That could help people understand issues that people of different races might face, said Hutchins, at the University of Houston. But to really effect change, any company needed to develop a range of measures ‚Äì changing policies and procedures, as McGhee outlined; mentoring staff; and making sure that it was hiring a diverse staff.

‚ÄúAnd all of that signals to the general employee that diversity is not just something you talk about,‚Äù Hutchins said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not something that just appears as a few words on our company webpage or in the annual report, but that it‚Äôs something that is an ongoing, lived-up-to value.‚Äù"
https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/starbucks-arrest-1.4630635,"If you were surprised to hear about two black men arrested at Starbucks, you haven't been paying attention",23/04/2018,https://www.cbc.ca,"A little over a week ago, two black men were arrested at a Starbucks in Philadelphia for doing what many of us have done at least once: sat down without ordering anything.

The men reportedly refused to leave after being denied use of the washroom because they hadn't bought anything. Yet many people pop in and out of Starbucks to use the washroom, and many people sit there without buying anything. And they don't get arrested for it.

Sometimes we're waiting for a blind date or a Tinder match to hopefully show up. Sometimes the line is too long (or often in my case, the baristas are too busy having a chat amongst themselves to take your order) so we wait for it to die down. Sometimes our business partner is running late. Sometimes it's really cold or wet outside and we need a respite. This is the environment that Starbucks has created for itself.

In fact, Starbucks prides itself on being the place to be: your office space away from home. It welcomes you to stay: it offers free Wi-Fi and places to charge your devices. It even takes up more of your time by asking its baristas to slow down and bring back that ""handcrafted"" feel.

Much of its brand is about that relaxing atmosphere; it aims to make its cafes an experience rather than just places to breeze in and out. It's focused on bringing people together, as its mission statement reads: ""To inspire and nurture the human spirit ‚Äì one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.""

An insider's club

But Starbucks, for all its talk about togetherness, is very much a white, middle-class brand. It's found in gentrified areas. In comparison to other popular North American coffee companies, it's expensive and its menu can be difficult to understand (Venti non-fat, extra hot, no foam, 12 pumps of syrup caramel macchiato latte, please). Its brand philosophy is about being a socially ethical company.

For many people of colour in the U.S. ‚Äî who are disproportionately affected by poverty ‚Äî Starbucks is unattainable, at least on a daily basis. It's an insider's club at best, a strategic initiative geared toward drawing in its preferred type of customer and keeping the others out.

Starbucks is not particularly unique in being a white and middle-class space: in fact, most public spaces can be characterized this way. Jane H. Hill explored this idea in her 1998 journal article ""Language, Race, and Public Space,"" in which she describes the ways that people of colour are under constant, intense monitoring ‚Äî of their speech, of their presence, of their appearance ‚Äî while in white spaces.

The incident at Starbucks earlier this month was a testament to what happens when black bodies enter a white space. Immediately, the men were deemed suspicious for doing something that employees know dozens of people do at their store each day.

The neighbourhood where the men were arrested is Rittenhouse Square, one of the wealthiest areas of Philadelphia, where a large majority of inhabitants are white.

In other words: the men were most definitely in wealthy, white space. Their presence scared the manager. And what do we do when we're scared of someone? We call the police.

Skewed perceptions

Black people have always been viewed as inherently criminal, but that's especially true for black men, who have long been stereotyped as dangerous, violent and brutish. One black man is often enough to make someone nervous. Two makes people think something's about to go down.

We know from various studies that people tend to see a black man as larger and more threatening than a white man of the same stature. We also know that black men are overrepresented in carding and stop-and-frisks.

We know that those of minority groups are most likely to be the victims of police brutality, and that police have even taken to shooting dead unarmed black men. We definitely know the role that stereotypes, racism and discrimination play in these issues.

Black and brown bodies, once they enter in white spaces, are often and immediately perceived as a threat to the perfectly established whiteness ‚Äî the normalness ‚Äî of the area. People experience fear because they're not supposed to be there; they're supposed to be in some far-away place closed into itself: the hood. The ghetto. Public housing. Somewhere where they are not a nuisance.

Fear of looking suspicious is why so many black people are careful when walking through these spaces. Parks. Sidewalks at night. Museums. The ballet. ""Upscale"" restaurants and bars. Coffee shops.

Protests continue at Philadelphia Starbucks despite apology Duration 1:12 Community accuses franchise manager of racism after two black men arrested then released without charge

To be clear, this is not just a problem in public spaces in the U.S.. As Canadians, we tend to deflect when we hear about acts of racism down south, but that doesn't mean the same sort of divisions don't happen here also, with certain types of people filtering into certain coffee shops, and others filtering into the rest. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, Starbucks Canada has not said whether it intends to follow its U.S. counterpart's plan to shut down thousands of stores in May to give employees ""racial-bias training.""

After the incident became international news, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson issued a personal apology to the men who were arrested. In a statement, he said that the actions in the video ""are not representative of our Starbucks mission and values."" But isn't it? Starbucks brand seems like it was never meant to include black people ‚Äî it was meant to centre whiteness. It was only a matter of time before one of its employees was caught on camera reminding us that it's not where we belong.

https://whyy.org/articles/the-woman-behind-the-viral-video-of-philly-starbucks-arrests/,The woman behind the viral video of Philly Starbucks arrests,25/04/2018,https://whyy.org,"When police arrested two black men at the Starbucks near Philadelphia‚Äôs Rittenhouse Square nearly two weeks ago, bystanders documented the incident with smartphone videos. One, in particular, went viral on Twitter.

Philadelphia writer Melissa DePino posted a video of Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson just after Philadelphia police arrested them for refusing to leave the store when an employee denied them access to the restroom. Nelson and Robinson had not purchased anything and were waiting for a friend.

In an interview with WHYY‚Äôs Morning Edition host Jennifer Lynn, DePino says their only crime was being black in an America rife with racial bias.

You can listen to their interview, edited slightly for time, above. The entire transcript of their conversation follows.

You saw Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson arrested in the Starbucks. You did not videotape the arrests. Who did?

There were a few people who videotaped the arrests. There was a woman sitting next to me videotaping, and there were a couple others also videotaping that day.

Who was the person?

The woman next to me was named Lauren. She shared the video with me right after she took it.

You‚Äôre the one who posted it on Twitter. In a piece you wrote for CNN.com, you said you did it because it felt like the right thing to do. Was there ever a question in your mind to post it, or not post it?

Honestly, I didn‚Äôt even think about it. It just felt like the right impulse right in the moment, and that‚Äôs what I did. There wasn‚Äôt a lot of thought behind it truthfully.

You said at first you didn‚Äôt think the video would draw much attention. Why?

Well, I think, or I know, that these things happen every day. Things that are dramatic and painful reminders of racism in this country today. Things dramatic and things not dramatic. Things that are smaller, quieter indignities. I feel like they don‚Äôt get the attention they deserve. I do wonder, was this shared so widely because it was by someone who looks like me?

Before we are speaking now, we spoke a few days ago and you said ‚Äì well, here you are firmly in the center of a national conversation about race ‚Äî and you said you have to stay in your lane. What do you mean by that?

What I mean by that is, as a white person, I have never experienced anything like what those gentlemen experienced or what any other people of color in this country experience every day that is a result of racism. So I can‚Äôt possibly speak to what that feels like, because I have privilege that protects me from that. So, what I feel would be the best thing is that people who don‚Äôt experience it listen and seek out and amplify the voices of people who are actually experiencing it. Because, I‚Äôm not the one to explain it. I‚Äôm just the one to spark the conversation. Hopefully there are others like me who are willing to continue to spark the conversation.

There‚Äôs plenty going on your Twitter. I see you as this kind of curator of the conversation on Twitter. You‚Äôre hearing from supporters, and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre hearing from haters. I even saw comedian Wanda Sykes posted, ‚ÄòWe need to close the country for racial bias training.‚Äô Slate.com said something like, ‚ÄòIn America, blackness means you‚Äôre a problem, not a customer.‚Äô You responded, ‚ÄòYes.‚Äô

Right, there are so many pieces to this. I, even having experienced this, and all the things that I have learned since then, I can‚Äôt speak on with any authority. I did see that Wanda Sykes tweet, and I did retweet it because I see it as a way of amplifying the voice of someone who knows better than I do. So, that‚Äôs the tactic that I‚Äôve been

trying to take.

You‚Äôve also written that you had a well-meaning friend say to you that she was shocked by the video, didn‚Äôt think these things still happened. You said you think because the video was posted by someone she trusted ‚Äî you ‚Äî it sent a different message to her. Describe that.

I‚Äôve been saying that I‚Äôm not an authority on much except for being a middle-aged, upper-middle-class white woman who is interested in social justice and racial justice in the country. I am trying to be curious about it. I really firmly believe that there are so many in my generation that do hold these unconscious or conscious biases that they don‚Äôt look at and they don‚Äôt think about and they don‚Äôt consider. These are well-meaning friends, and I‚Äôm certainly well-meaning, but I don‚Äôt know the extent of how deep my biases go. I think looking at that is the most important thing that we can do and listening to people who know better.

There are even segregated social media places that we are on that we don‚Äôt even think about. Who are our followers? What are we conversing about on Twitter?

I‚Äôm not going to quote this very well, but there were a couple of different studies that came out in 2016 ‚Äî one was by Pew and the other one was by PRRI (Public Religion Research Institute), I believe, that talked about how essentially ‚Äî and I‚Äôm paraphrasing ‚Äî that our social media networks are very segregated, No. 1. Most white social media users, their networks are made up of mostly white social media users. The next step of that, in my mind, is this idea that on social media, white users aren‚Äôt talking about race. So, there are sort of two pieces to that. My having posted this ‚Äî and I hope it went to a lot of white users ‚Äî I hope that people in my social network and people in my circle of influence will then also share these things. Honestly, another complication to it is not just share things like these men being humiliated in front of the 10 million, 12 million who saw it, but things that are everyday indication of where we are in this country with racism. There is some criticism about we have to

see something this dramatic and we have to humiliate these people in the public eye in order to pay attention.

Have you spoken to Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson?

I have not, but I really admire what they did that day. They were so calm.

They were so calm and the situation did not escalate. What if this video was never posted? You said some others (videos) were taken.

I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm glad in many ways that I did post it because I do feel that it sparked a conversation particularly among a lot more white Americans. I hope that‚Äôs what it did. Given those statistics I mentioned, I‚Äôm not quite sure it did, but I hope that it did. The fact of the matter is that black and brown people have been posting these things all the time and not just dramatic events like this, and white America doesn‚Äôt seem to be listening. So, it‚Äôs become evident to me that we need to sort of bridge this gap when we can, and we need to pay attention.

Say something when you see something has become a mantra, for a lack of a better way to describe it, following this incident. Has the Starbucks manager been tried in the court of public opinion? I mean, we have not heard her response to the response to all of this. I‚Äôm wondering did she fail to consider how risky it is to call police on black males in this country?

Well, of course she failed, but it was likely a result of a deep bias that many white Americans hold and don‚Äôt look at. She likely had no idea how dangerous it is to call the police on black men, but that‚Äôs because of that communication divide, in my view. And the idea of us sort of looking at our privilege in a really honest way and feeling vulnerable and feeling uncomfortable and understanding how we can contribute to this productively as oppose to unproductively.

Some people see you as a hero for posting this video. Are you a hero?

Oh, my goodness. No, not at all. I appreciate everyone‚Äôs thanks. I did receive a lot of thanks for posting this, but the truth of the matter is, all I did was do what you should do. When you see something like this you expose it, and then you open the conversation to those who can speak about it better and in more of an educated way than you can. Because, as I said, I‚Äôm no expert at this at all. All I did was act as a witness, and if you want to talk about the lane we need to be in, I think that‚Äôs the lane we need to be in.

Thank you very much for your time.

Thank you so much, Jennifer."

A racially charged incident at a Philadelphia Starbucks earlier this month hasn't affected sales at the coffee chain, executives said Thursday on a conference call with investors about it latest earnings report.

The chain hasn't seen a drop in sales despite calls to boycott the company, CEO Kevin Johnson said. ""We are not seeing an impact on [same-store] sales as a result of Philadelphia,"" he said.

Johnson apologized for the incident at the start of the call, and said Starbucks' (SBUX) leadership team remains on the ground in Philadelphia. The company is closing 8,200 of its U.S. stores on May 29 to conduct a racial bias training for all its workers -- something Johnson said was only a ""small piece"" of the actions Starbucks planned in response to the episode.

""I am personally committed to act on several front to ensure it never happens again,"" he said.

Prior to the April 12 incident, Starbucks saw better-than-expected sales, it said in its earnings report released Thursday after the close of trading. The company said sales grew 2 percent at established stores worldwide during the quarter that ended April 1, compared to the 1.8 percent growth analysts expected, according to FactSet.

Sales in China, Starbucks' fastest-growing market, were up 4 percent. But customer traffic in Asia was flat.

Starbucks stock was down nearly 2 percent to $58.35 in after-hours trading.

The coffee shop chain has been tinkering with its food offerings in the U.S. in an effort to increase sales at lunchtime. It has also tried to streamline its business, including recently selling its Tazo tea brand and closing mall-based Teavana stores. It also recently opened its Mobile Order and Pay service to anyone using the Starbucks app, a service previously available only to Starbucks Rewards customers.

Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw and Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer said Starbucks has largely resolved problems that mobile orders had created at some pickup counters, and the sales have jumped at the stores where the congestion was the worst.

Starbucks' profits met Wall Street expectations. Net income was $660.1 million during the quarter. Adjusted earnings came to 53 cents per share, which was the same as forecasts, according to Zacks Investment Research. The company posted revenue of $6.03 billion in the period, exceeding estimates of $5.9 billion.

Starbucks also said it plans to buy back 100 million its shares, which are worth more than $5 billion at current prices."
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/27/starbucks-ceo-says-philadelphia-arrests-did-not-hurt-sales-in-march.html,Starbucks CEO says Philadelphia arrest protests have not hurt sales in April,27/04/2018,https://www.cnbc.com,"Starbucks sales in April were not affected by protests and calls of boycotts over the arrests of two black men at Philadelphia cafe, CEO Kevin Johnson said Friday.

A video of the arrest went viral two weeks ago, showing two men being arrested for trespassing after asking to use a Starbucks bathroom.

After the uproar, Starbucks management responded swiftly, meeting city officials and the men who were involved. Johnson was praised for his response, which included flying to meet the two men at a Starbucks in Philadelphia. In addition, the company told CNBC that the manager who called police ""is no longer at that store.""

While some speculated that sales might have been hit due to the incident, Johnson told Jim Cramer on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Friday that wasn't the case.

""I was on the ground in Philadelphia, understanding every aspect of that and we're going to do the right thing to be a better company because of that,"" Johnson said. ""We have not seen a negative impact on our national comps thus far in the month.""

The company plans to shut its company-owed cafes on May 29 for a seminar on racial bias. The event will likely result in millions of dollars in lost sales during the afternoon closure.

While mornings provide Starbucks with the majority of its sales, shuttering even for just a few hours in the afternoon could be costly.

In January, Chairman Howard Schultz said the average Starbucks store makes about $32,000 a week. Using that as a benchmark, 8,000 stores would make about $260 million in that period, or about $36.6 million a day.

If those locations are shut down in the afternoon, the company could easily lose 20 percent, if not more, of its daily sales, or about $7.3 million. Of course, this quick calculation doesn't take into account that morning sales are probably larger than afternoon sales or any revenue at the company's licensed stores, which will remain open.

Jeff Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean for leadership studies at Yale, estimates that Starbucks will lose about $12 million during the May closure."
