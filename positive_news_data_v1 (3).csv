The coffee giant announced Monday that it would eliminate single-use plastic straws from all of its cafes globally within the next two years. Instead, Starbucks will offer recyclable strawless lids and alternative-material straws, like paper or compostable plastic.

The company already uses plastic lids nationally for some of its drinks like nitro cold brew and any beverages topped with cold foam.

Starbucks said customers in Seattle and Vancouver will be the first to see these changes roll out in the fall.

On July 1, Seattle became the first U.S. city to ban plastic straws, utensils and cocktail picks. Next year, a ban on plastic straws and stirrers will go into effect in the United Kingdom and Ireland."
https://e360.yale.edu/digest/starbucks-joins-the-growing-movement-to-ban-plastic-straws,Starbucks Joins the Growing Movement to Ban Plastic Straws,https://e360.yale.edu,7/9/18,"Global coffeehouse chain Starbucks announced it will phase out plastic straws at its 28,000 locations by 2020, using recyclable strawless lids or straws made from alternative materials, like paper, Reuters reported. The announcement marks a significant victory for environmental groups that have urged cities and companies to ban single-use plastics.

“For our partners and customers, this is a significant milestone to achieve our global aspiration of sustainable coffee, served to our customers in more sustainable ways,” Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said in a statement.

Starbucks’ decision comes just one week after Seattle’s ban on plastic straws and utensils at “all food service businesses, including restaurants, grocery stores, delis, coffee shops, food trucks, and institutional cafeterias,” took effect. New York City and San Francisco are said to be considering similar bans. A ban on plastic packaging — including bags, Styrofoam, takeout containers, and utensils — in the Indian state of Maharashtra also took effect last month. And McDonald’s announced last month that it would stop using plastic straws at its locations in the United Kingdom, which approved a single-use plastic ban in April, and Ireland by the end of 2019. The restaurant chain also said it would test the straw policy in a half-dozen other countries, including the United States, in the coming years.

An estimated 8 million tons of plastic waste ends up in the world’s oceans annually, according to the U.N. Environment Program. About 63 billion straws were used in the U.S. in 2017, equal to around 170 to 175 million straws per day, according to Reuters.

Starbucks said it will start using strawless lids in its Seattle and Vancouver locations this fall, with plans to expand their usage to all U.S. and Canadian restaurants next year. The phase-out of plastic straws will then move to Europe and other locations."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/07/09/starbucks-will-stop-handing-out-plastic-straws-by-2020/,Starbucks will stop handing out plastic straws by 2020,https://www.washingtonpost.com,7/9/18,"Starbucks, which doles out more than 1 billion straws a year, says it will phase out single-use plastic straws from its stores by 2020. The coffee giant – the largest retailer to commit to eliminating single-use plastic straws – said Monday that it will replace the ubiquitous plastic straw with recyclable “strawless lids,” as well as straws made from biodegradable materials, as part of a no-plastic-straws movement that has gained momentum in recent years.

Starbucks — which has more than 28,000 stores and generated $22.4 billion in annual revenue last year — said that more than half of its beverage sales come from cold drinks, which typically come with a plastic straw.

At Starbucks, executives said the efforts are part of a $10 million plan to develop cups and lids that are fully recyclable and compostable. Stores in Seattle and Vancouver will be the first to begin using the new strawless lids — essentially a top with a built-in lip for easy drinking — which will be used for iced coffee, tea and espresso drinks beginning in the fall. Ice-blended Frappuccinos, meanwhile, will be served with straws made of paper or compostable plastic.

The company also offers a 10-cent discount to customers who bring in their own cups.

Starbucks declined to comment on the financial impact of replacing plastic straws, which have become widely used in restaurants in part because they are so cheap. (Starbucks now charges a 5-pence paper cup fee in its U.K. stores, though it was unclear whether the company would add similar surcharges in the United States.)

The no-straw movement, which had already been brewing in certain communities and beach towns, gained mainstream traction three years ago after a video showing a sea turtle with a plastic straw wedged in its nose went viral. Plastic straws never completely decompose and can be harmful, even fatal, to animals that ingest them.

A number of local governments — from Malibu, Calif., to Miami Beach, Florida — have recently passed legislation restricting the use and distribution of plastic straws. Starbucks’s hometown of Seattle banned plastic straws and utensils beginning this month, while California cities including Malibu, Davis and San Luis Obispo prohibit restaurants from handing out plastic straws unless a customer requests one.

Restaurants and private establishments have also taken measures to curb their use of plastic straws. Some offer more environmentally friendly alternatives, such as straws made of paper, bamboo, steel, even Twizzlers. Walt Disney World has banned plastic straws at some of its theme parks, while the Smithsonian Institution has taken steps to eliminate them from its museums. Hyatt Hotels said Monday it will stop offering plastic straws and picks to customers at its 700 hotels, unless they specifically ask for one.

“This is a significant milestone to achieve our global aspiration of sustainable coffee, served to our customers in more sustainable ways,” Kevin Johnson, president and chief executive of Starbucks, said in a statement.

Plastic straws typically cost less than a half-cent each, while paper varieties can easily run four times that, according to Kara Woodring, a sales representative at Aardvark, a Colo.-based paper straw manufacturer. But, she said, demand for alternatives to plastic have been on the upswing for over a decade. Ted’s Montana Grill, the restaurant chain founded by media mogul Ted Turner, was one of the earliest to switch to paper straws back in 2007.

“Straws are kind of an unnecessary item we’ve gotten accustomed to,” Woodring said earlier this year. “If you can go without, that’s great.”

The announcement by Starbucks comes four weeks after McDonald’s announced it would replace plastic straws with paper ones at its 1,300 restaurants in the U.K., where plastic straws and stirrers will be banned beginning next year, and Ireland. The fast-food giant, which is the world’s largest restaurant chain by revenue, is also testing alternatives in the United States and now offers compostable straws in Seattle.

https://www.teenvogue.com/story/starbucks-to-ban-single-use-plastic-straws-2020,Starbucks Announces Plans to Ban Single-Use Plastic Straws by 2020,https://www.teenvogue.com,7/9/18,"Starbucks is jumping on the strawless bandwagon. On Monday, the coffee giant became the latest company to denounce single-use plastic straws, revealing plans to ban them entirely from its stores worldwide by 2020. Instead, Starbucks announced in a press release, it will start using ""strawless lids"" and straws made from ""alternative materials,"" such as paper or ""compostable plastic."" According to the press release, these straws will be available by request.

As for the ""strawless lids,"" Starbucks is already using them in about 8,000 select stores around North America. These currently come with drinks like the Starbucks Draft Nitro and Cold Foam, and will come with the Salted Cream Cold Foam Cold Brew to be released on Tuesday. They essentially look like sippy cup lids — regular plastic lids with a raised and slanted mouthpiece for customers to drink from.

Starbucks joins companies, cities, and countries around the world that have banned plastic straws. As Fast Company reported, plastic straws have been banned or are planned to be banned by Alaska Airlines and McDonald's U.K., as well as in Vancouver, the U.K., Taiwan, Seattle, Miami Beach, and in California cities such as Oakland and Berkeley, to name a few.

But while such policies are intended to reduce plastic pollution in the ocean, as Pacific Standard reported, they've been questioned for their effectiveness and criticized for being ableist. As BBC News reported in February, a Scotland-based disability group called One in Five says paper, plant-based, and metal straws aren't adequate substitutes for single-use plastic straws and could even be dangerous for people, depending on their disability.

""As you may be aware most paper and plant-based alternatives are not flexible or suitable for drinks over 40C, therefore increases the risks of choking,"" One in Five wrote in a letter, according to BBC News. ""Metal straws can be dangerous for people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's whereas reusable plastic straws present hygiene concerns to people with specific health conditions.""

Starbucks says that customers in Seattle and Vancouver will be the first to go strawless beginning this fall, with more markets to follow."
https://www.cnet.com/culture/internet/starbucks-will-ditch-plastic-straws-for-fancy-designer-lids/,Starbucks is banning plastic straws by 2020 for a good reason,https://www.cnet.com,7/9/18,"With the plastic-filled Great Pacific Garbage Patch growing like a monster and everyone from Seattle to the EU looking into or outright banning single-use plastics, global coffee company Starbucks saw the future. And it is plastic-strawless.

Starbucks announced on Monday it will phase out plastic straws at over 28,000 company operated and licensed shops by 2020.

But you won't have to apply your lips directly to the side of a cup. Starbucks will instead offer a new strawless lid or straws made from plastic alternatives to fulfill your drinking desires.

Starbucks expects the change to eliminate over a billion plastic straws each year. The strawless lid is a big part of the coffee chain's plans. It looks like a modified version of the sippy cups that are popular drinking utensils for toddlers. The lid is already available for certain cold drinks in 8,000 US Starbucks stores.

A research and development team at Starbucks headed up by engineer Emily Alexander started work on the new lid in 2016. The company describes the final design as featuring ""a teardrop-shaped opening about the size of a thumbprint."" It took 10 weeks of experimentation and testing to arrive at that point.

The new lids are still made from plastic, but from a type that is recyclable in many locations. ""By nature, the straw isn't recyclable and the lid is, so we feel this decision is more sustainable and more socially responsible,"" said Starbucks director of packaging sourcing Chris Milne.

The elimination of plastic straws is one phase of a larger sustainability plan. Starbucks is also working on developing a fully recyclable and compostable hot cup.

Frappuccino fans don't have to worry about trying to suck the slushy beverage through a sippy cup hole. Starbucks will offer straws made from paper or compostable plastic made from fermented plant starch for the popular icy drinks.

Coffee giant Starbucks plans to eliminate plastic straws globally by 2020, joining the Chicago White Sox, food service provider Bon Appétit Management Company, Alaska Airlines and the city of Seattle. Likewise, notables such as Chelsea Clinton and Tom Brady have also pledged to refuse plastic straws when handed to them, adding fuel to the social media trend #StopSucking.

The war on single-use plastics is just starting

Starbucks' welcomed announcement comes on the heels of similar pledges by countries, cities and corporations around the world — most with less cachet than Starbucks, but equally important. For example, India’s heavily plastic-polluted state of Maharashtra recently announced a ban on all single-use plastics, and Costa Rica wants do the same by 2021. Meanwhile, McDonalds, which isn’t much bigger in terms of annual revenue, but gives away exponentially more straws per day (95 million estimated straws per day) versus Starbucks (approximately 3 million per day), is still dragging its giant feet, but says it is studying alternatives. And with enough public pressure, convenience stores like 7-Eleven will find alternative ways to consume their ""Big Gulps.""

With companies and governments jumping on the bandwagon and banning various forms of single-use plastics, one would expect that the handwriting is on the wall for straws and other forms of single-use plastics as a whole. Unfortunately, that is not the case. In 2015, China opened one of the largest plastic straw manufacturing plants in the world in Allentown, Pa., churning out hundreds of millions of plastic straws each year, and claiming they make enough each year to circle the globe one and a half times. Likewise, Tetra Pak, which has produced up to 4 billion plastic straws each year, has gone on the offensive, hiring lobbyists to stop the plastic straw ban although it maybe hedging its bets as it also recently announced it will develop paper alternatives for some products. And unfortunately, Amazon and other global retailers are ramping up a fight against India’s plastic ban.

While straw wars are just beginning to have an impact, the real answers lie in entrepreneurism and consumer education. Somebody will make a lot of money inventing an alternative to plastic straws and consumers will have to find the alternative palatable. But in the end people and our planet will be the big winners — although at time of writing this, Starbucks stock was up.

Kathleen Rogers is the president of Earth Day Network. Earth Day Network is running a global End Plastic Pollution campaign called #EndPlasticPollution.

What our readers are saying

What a crock. Straws are not what is clogging up landfills and our oceans. You want to ban something, try banning what's really filling them up. There are so many other things that we should look in to besides plastic straws, like disposable diapers for example.

Also, there is nothing worse than a paper straw for a drink.

— Andrew Goetz

Coal, oil and natural gas are not evil. And neither is plastic, which is made from natural resources. Like every other man-made product, it's the human consumer who dictates its impact on our environment and not the product itself.

What others are saying

Radhika Viswanathan, Vox: ""Several environmental organizations have made straw bans a priority lately — raising awareness, nudging celebrities to come out in favor of them, lobbying cities and states to enact them. But some advocates told me their deeper motivation is to build support and awareness for the need to ban other plastic products that are more significant sources of plastic solution than straws. 'Our straw campaign is not really about straws,' said Dune Ives, the executive director of Lonely Whale, the organization that led the straw ban movement in Seattle.""

David Mastio, USA TODAY: ""Before Americans get too worked up about this latest blight on the reputation of plastics, there are a few facts about those vast piles of plastic floating in the ocean that you might not have heard: They aren’t made of plastic bags and straws; they’re mostly made of abandoned fishing equipment. A second big contributor wasn’t man throwing things away, but a tsunami striking Japan and sweeping all kinds of things out to sea. While thousands of tons of the plastic floating out there were thrown away, they weren’t thrown away here. Asia is home to five out of the five biggest plastic polluters. Oh, and banning things such as single-use plastic bags and straws isn’t among the best solutions to stopping the pollution of our oceans, but setting vast amounts of waste plastic on fire is.

https://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/a22091470/starbucks-bans-straws-for-environment/,Starbucks Is Banning Plastic Straws to Save the Planet,https://www.esquire.com,7/9/18,"Starbucks is doing the right thing and getting rid of plastic straws.

The company announced Monday that by 2020, every single plastic straw will be phased out of use at Starbucks stores around the globe. The effort, which starts this fall in Seattle and Vancouver and spreads from there, is expected to keep 1 billion Starbucks-green straws out of the Earth's garbage dumps and oceans each year.

To replace straws, Starbucks will serve cold drinks in cups with special lids—dubbed ""adult sippy cups"" by the Internet—which it introduced back in 2016. These lids can be recycled, unlike the straws. And for all those Starbucks addicts who still demand a straw to suck down their icy frapps, baristas will have paper and compostable plastic straws on hand. (Compostable plastic straws are not marine biodegradable.)

Getting rid of plastic straws will not save our oceans, environmentalists warn. But it will cut down on plastic pollution that kills marine life, and trash waste in general. Even more importantly, it's one of the easiest uses of plastic for us to give up, and once we do, we might want to rid more plastic from our lives. Call it a ""gateway plastic.""

In other environmentally friendly news, Starbucks' hometown Seattle just kicked off a city-wide ban on plastic straws, making it the first major U.S. city to do so. If this trend spreads (and hopefully, it will), we'll be drinking our iced coffees and diet pop with a little less guilt."

The Seattle-based company said on Monday it will instead use straws made from other materials, and lids designed not to need straws.

McDonald’s also recently said it would switch to paper straws in the UK and Ireland by next year, and test alternatives to plastic straws in some US locations. In February, Dunkin’ Donuts said that it would eliminate polystyrene foam cups from its stores by 2020.

Environmental activists have been pressuring businesses to ditch plastic straws because they can end up in the ocean and hurt marine life. The push gained traction after a viral video in 2015 showed rescuers removing a straw from a sea turtle’s nose in graphic detail.

Local governments have also been looking at the issue. Last week, Seattle’s ban on single-use plastic straws and utensils in food service outlets took effect, and Starbucks says it already offers alternative straws there. Similar proposals are being considered elsewhere, including New York and San Francisco.

While straws have become a high-profile issue, they make up only about 4% of the plastic trash by number of pieces, and far less by weight. Straws add up to only about 2,000 tons of the nearly 9m tons of plastic waste that hits waters each year.

Still, those who support limiting plastic straws say they are generally unnecessary and a ban is good symbol.

The strawless lids will begin to appear in Seattle and Vancouver Starbucks this fall, with phased rollouts within the US and Canada to follow next year.

A global rollout of the strawless lids will follow, beginning in Europe where they will be used in selected stores in France and the Netherlands, as well as in the United Kingdom."
https://www.earth.com/news/starbucks-plastic-straws/,Starbucks to phase out plastic straws worldwide by 2020,https://www.earth.com,7/9/18,"Starbucks announced on Monday that they will be phasing out their single-use plastic straws worldwide by 2020. This move comes at a time when scientists are calling our plastic pollution problem a “global crisis” and advocacy groups are warning that plastic poses one of the greatest threats to our oceans.

Phasing out the plastic straw could have huge positive impacts. Starbucks gives out an estimated 1 billion straws a year. By 2020, the coffee chain will replace their straws with a recyclable straw-less lid, made from biodegradable materials.

In a press release, Starbucks said “Starbucks has designed, developed and manufactured a strawless lid, which will become the standard for all iced coffee, tea and espresso beverages. The lid is currently available in more than 8,000 stores in the U.S. and Canada for select beverages including Starbucks Draft Nitro and Cold Foam.”

Customers who need straws for medical and other reasons can still help protect our oceans. Starbucks will start providing straws made from more sustainable sources such as paper and compostable plastic by request.

Currently, Starbucks is the largest food and beverage retailer to phase out plastic straws worldwide. Plastic straws are far from the only plastic destroying our oceans, but their impacts are certainly severe.

A 2015 video of a sea turtle with a straw stuck up its nostril quickly went viral with over 30 million views to date. The difficult-to-watch video shows a person trying to dislodge a straw from the turtle’s nostril as the turtle struggles.

When plastic is polluted into our waterways, it stays in the environment forever. The United States National Park Service says, “Once in the water, plastic never fully biodegrades, but breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces, eventually being dubbed a ‘microplastic’ —something that is less than 5mm long and still able to cause problems for marine life.”

Plastic, whether in large or small pieces, can wreak havoc on marine animals by choking them, entangling them and entering their stomachs, potentially causing them to starve to death.

A pivotal study in 2015, published in Science, found that 4.8 to 12.7 metric tons of plastic waste entered our oceans in 2010 alone.

Starbucks policy change is much needed but not enough on its own. While addressing plastic straws is a great start, our society is now addicted to plastic. Single-use plastic can be found everywhere: from our utensils to our bags and water bottles.

Policy changes surrounding plastic are also occurring at the local government level. The city of Seattle recently became the first US city to ban plastic utensils and straws. The ban affects bars and restaurants in the city and went into effect last week.

“Plastic pollution is surpassing crisis levels in the world’s oceans, and I’m proud Seattle is leading the way and setting an example for the nation by enacting a plastic straw ban,” Seattle Public Utilities General Manager Mami Hara said in a statement about the ban.

Starbucks and Seattle have both set good examples for how we should be handling the plastic pollution crisis. Actions from both corporations and governments will help to most efficiently protect our oceans.

The coffee chain said on Monday that it has invented “strawless lids” and “alternative-material straws” that will save an estimated 1 billion plastic straws from being thrown out from its stores each year.

This type of lid that does not require the use of a straw is currently found in 8,000 stores across North America and its availability has been expanded to east Asian countries. A global rollout of the eco-friendly products will come later in the year.

“For our partners and customers, this is a significant milestone to achieve our global aspiration of sustainable coffee, served to our customers in more sustainable ways,” Starbucks CEO and President Kevin Johnson said.

Nicholas Mallos, director of Ocean Conservancy’s Trash Free Seas program, commended the move as a “a shining example of the important role that companies can play in stemming the tide of ocean plastic.”

Starbucks promotes its ethical and eco-friendly practices and cites its “long history in sustainability.”

The company, which buys 5 percent of the global supply of Arabica beans, announced in 2015 that it “ethically sourced” 99 percent of its coffee. The coffee purveyor has enacted other policies to reduce its environmental impact and appeal to younger, socially conscious consumers. This includes its decision to charge extra money for paper cups in London — a practice which will expand across the UK later this year.

The movement for a plastic-free sip

The plastic straw ban is having a moment, and Starbucks is by no means the first to hop on the bandwagon. The organization was born and bred in the city of Seattle. The mayor there announced a limited ban on disposable plastics — straws and cutlery — that went into effect on July 1.

New York has also proposed legislation to ban plastic straws in the city by 2020, and Malibu, California; Miami Beach; and Fort Myers, Florida; and other cities have similar efforts in the works. Vox’s Radhika Viswanathan explained the movement to ban plastic straws:

But Starbucks, one of the largest buyers of disposable plastic straws in the US, is a significant new participant in this plastic-free drive. And this could be just the beginning of something larger. While straws aren’t the biggest plastic monster to defeat, activists believe that eliminating the worldwide use of disposable straws could kick off a wider conversation about plastic use in general.

Viswanathan continued:

“Our straw campaign is not really about straws,” said Dune Ives, the executive director of Lonely Whale, the organization that led the straw ban movement in Seattle. “It’s about pointing out how prevalent single-use plastics are in our lives. Putting up a mirror to hold us accountable. We’ve all been asleep at the wheel.”

The focus on eliminating disposable plastics comes at a time when threats to the environment are immense. Studies have found that about 71 percent of seabirds and 30 percent of turtles have some form of plastic in their stomachs. Marine creatures have a 50 percent mortality rate when they ingest any form of plastic.

Starbucks is at the forefront of a movement that will work to cull contributions to the 8 million metric tons of plastic already in the ocean. And while banning straws is only the beginning, it’s at least a start."
https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/starbucks-vows-ditch-plastic-straws-2020-180969573/,Starbucks Vows to Ditch Plastic Straws by 2020. How Will the Oceans Change?,https://www.smithsonianmag.com,7/9/18,"In a bid to reduce plastic waste in oceans, Starbucks will phase out plastic straws from all of its stores by 2020. As Jennifer Liberto of NPR reports, the coffee chain has announced that its 28,000 locations will gradually replace the straws with custom-designed recyclable lids that have drawn comparisons to “adult sippy cups.”

The new lids are already being popped onto a small number of Starbucks’ cold drinks, but a wider rollout will begin this fall in Starbucks stores in Vancouver, Canada, and Seattle, Washington, according to Danielle Wiener-Bronner of CNN. The company said in a statement that the straw-free lids will eventually become the standard option for all cold drinks except the Frappuccino, which will be served with paper or compostable plastic straws.

Starbucks states that the switch from single-use straws to lids means that 1 billion fewer straws will be used in its stores each year. The lids are made from a type of plastic called polypropylene, which, unlike straws, is recyclable. “[W]e feel this decision is more sustainable and more socially responsible,” Chris Milne, director of packaging sourcing for Starbucks, says in the statement.

The company’s announcement comes one week after Seattle, where Starbucks is headquartered, became the first major U.S. city to ban plastic utensils and straws. New York and San Francisco are considering similar measures, according to the Associated Press, and smaller cities in California, like Malibu and San Luis Obispo, have already started cracking down on the consumption of plastic straws and other utensils.

Starbucks is also not the first major company to reckon with its use of plastic straws. Shortly after U.K. prime minister Theresa May announced her plans to ban plastic straws and several other plastic products, McDonald’s, which goes through an estimated 95 million straws each day, vowed to switch to paper straws in all of its locations in the U.K. and Ireland. Nearly 500,000 people have signed a petition by the advocacy group SumOfUs calling on the fast food chain to stop using plastic straws worldwide—but McDonald’s shareholders ultimately rejected a proposal to do just that.

The number of plastic straws that are used globally and that end up in waterways is unclear, but improperly discarded straws can undoubtedly have a dire impact on the environment. They get eaten by fish and pose a danger to other marine creatures; a hard-to-watch viral video of a straw being removed from a turtle’s nostril may have kicked off a global push for the reduction of plastic straw use, reports Laura Parker of National Geographic.

In reality, however, straws make up a relatively small proportion of the huge amount of plastic that is being dumped into the world’s oceans. Adam Minter of Bloomberg reports that straws account for less than .03 percent of the approximately 8 million metric tons of plastics that make their way into the ocean each year. In the Ocean Conservancy’s 2017 Coastal Cleanup Report, straws only ranked 7th in a list of trash types that had been collected from beaches in 112 countries, lagging behind more ubiquitous offenders like cigarette butts and plastic bottles and caps.

Why, then, have some environmentalists been focusing their efforts on plastic straw reduction? In some ways, straws are an easy target. With the exception of people with certain disabilities who rely on straws to drink, we don’t really need to use plastic straws. And truly cutting back on plastic waste in the ocean would be a mammoth undertaking. Surveys have found, for example, that 46 percent of the plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, by weight, is abandoned fishing gear, but creating policies to reduce ""ghost gear,"" which would require international cooperation, is much more complex than simply skipping the straw for your iced latte.

Straws are also, environmentalists hope, an entry point to a larger conversation.

“Our straw campaign is not really about straws,” Dune Ives, executive director of Lonely Whale, which spearheaded Seattle’s anti-straw movement, tells Radhika Viswanathan of Vox. “It’s about pointing out how prevalent single-use plastics are in our lives. Putting up a mirror to hold us accountable. We’ve all been asleep at the wheel.”"

Last month, McDonald's said it will start testing plastic straw alternatives at select US locations this year.

The announcements come amid calls from environmental activists urging American cities and food conglomerates to ditch plastic straws.

The effort to ban straws may seem like misplaced energy relative to the scale of all plastic waste, but it may serve as a litmus test for similar bans in the future.

Two of the largest food conglomerates are moving toward ditching single-use plastic straws.

On Monday, Starbucks announced that it will eliminate plastic straws globally by 2020. McDonald's said last month that it plans to test plastic straw alternatives at select US locations this year. In the UK, the fast-food giant has already decided to adopt biodegradable paper straws by 2019. And Bon Appétit Management, a food-service company with 1,000 US locations, announced last May that it's phasing out plastic straws as well.

Meanwhile, several American cities have enacted their own bans or have proposals in the works. In 2012, Miami Beach banned hotels from serving straws because they were ending up on the sand and in the ocean, threatening marine life. Fort Myers, Florida and Seattle took the same steps in January 2018.

New York City, as well as cities in Hawaii and California, have pending straw-ban legislation, too.

Much of the reasoning behind straw bans is environmental. Because plastic straws are tiny and take more than 400 years to biodegrade, they commonly slip through the cracks of cities' waste-recycling processes, clogging ponds, rivers, and oceans. And unlike their plastic counterparts (like forks, takeout containers, plastic bags, etc.), straws don't offer a purpose besides a bit of convenience.

In addition, disposing of plastic waste costs cities a lot of money. New York City, for example, spends at least $10 million a year to transport plastic, which includes straws and bags, to out-of-state landfills. Not offering plastic straws, or switching to metal ones, saves food companies money, too.

A growing plastic problem

Plastic straws make up a small fraction of all plastic waste. The most predominant types of plastic pollution are food wrappers and containers, which account for an estimated 31.1% of all plastic waste globally in 2017, according to a report from several environmental groups. That's followed by plastic bottle and container caps (15.5%), bags (11.2%), straws and stirrers (8.1%), beverage bottles (7.3%), and takeout containers (6.3%). Out of all the plastic that ends up in the ocean, straws comprise 4% of that waste, according to a 2018 study from a group of Australian scientists.

In the past six decades, the mass production of plastics has increased so rapidly that it has generated around 6.3 billion metric tons of trash as of 2015. A 2017 study from researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, found that globally, 91% of all plastic isn't recycled.

Much of this plastic pollutes the world's beaches, oceans, and landfills, and gets eaten by unsuspecting marine life.

Banning plastic straws could serve as a litmus test

While focusing on straws may seem like misplaced energy relative to more significant types of plastic waste, straw-ban legislation could lay the groundwork for wider plastic bans in the future.

Some metros have struggled to pass bans on larger types of plastic waste — like grocery bags, cups, and cutlery — due to concerns that the changes would be too jarring to consumers.

In April 2018, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed a statewide plastic bag ban, but it has faced skepticism in the state legislature. According to Popular Science, some representatives see such regulations as evidence of government overreach.

The plastic industry has largely opposed plastic bans and pushed for rules against the bans. Some officials have also argued that the power to enact such bans should lie with state governments, not individual cities.

In Tempe, Arizona, a city with 182,000 people, at least 50 million plastic bags get thrown away each year, according to New York Magazine. Tempe tried to implement legislation to limit plastic bag use, but in 2015, the Arizona State Legislature passed a bill that effectively outlawed bans on plastic products.

In 2017, Michigan became the seventh US state to do the same.

Compared to plastic bags and containers, straws are an easier form of plastic waste for cities and businesses to eliminate — or, at the very least, find biodegradable alternatives for.

In Starbucks' hometown of Seattle, the legislation the city passed in January seems to have prompted the company's straw ban. According to the new regulation, businesses that sell drinks will need to ditch their single-use straws by July 2019.

Starbucks has a simple strategy to eliminate straws. First, the chain plans to launch recyclable straw-less lids and straws made from non-plastic materials. The company will roll out the initatives in two phases, starting in Seattle and Vancouver this fall, a company spokesperson told Business Insider. Starbucks locations throughout the rest of the world will follow by 2020."

As You Sow is pleased to learn via news reports of Starbucks’ commitment to phase out plastic straws at all stores by 2020. A shareholder proposal filed by As You Sow and voted on by shareholders in March, asking the company to phase out plastic straws, received the support of nearly 30% of shareholders, with shares worth $54 billion. The proposal was presented by Adrian Grenier, co-founder of Lonely Whale and UN Environment Goodwill Ambassador. In addition, environmental groups collected 1 million signatures on a petition asking for similar action, which was presented to company CEO Kevin Johnson.

“We applaud this action by the company and actions taken to focus its design efforts on meeting this ambitious goal,” said Conrad MacKerron, As You Sow’s senior vice president. “This action is good news for global plastic pollution reduction and ocean protection efforts.”

“We look forward to learning more about the specific details of this commitment,” MacKerron added. “The company mentions using compostable plastic straws as well as paper straws. It is important that compostable plastic straws are used only in locations where there are composting systems in place to actually process them. Otherwise, these straws will continue to generate plastic trash.”

“I have been vocal in my requests of Starbucks to #StopSucking and start taking bold steps towards more sustainable business practices,” said Adrian Grenier. “This past March I had the opportunity to present, as a Starbucks shareholder, a vision for a Strawless Ocean. Today, I am thrilled to celebrate Starbucks’ bold leadership for Clean Seas with its commitment to phase out its plastic straws by 2020. Starbucks taught the world how to drink coffee, and I believe that this commitment will help teach the world how to embrace sustainable business practices—starting with the plastic straw.”

Experience has shown that more frequent public reporting and candor about the ability to achieve ambitious goals is necessary after corporate sustainability commitments are announced. In 2008, Starbucks pledged that by 2015, 25% of beverages would be served in reusable containers and 100% of paper and plastic cups would be recyclable at all owned stores. Today, less than 2% of beverages are served in reusable cups and only 60% of stores have cup recycling. As You Sow applauds this action on straws, but looks forward to future announcements from the company on renewed efforts to meet its original 2008 goals on recycling and reusables, which were also requested in our proposal in addition to action on straws. This is especially important since straws make up only about 4% of the plastic trash by number of pieces, and far less by weight. Straws add up to only about 2,000 tons of the nearly 9m tons of plastic waste that hits waters each year.

While the media often dismisses shareholder votes that receive less than 50% support as “failures,” this positive result by Starbucks is another example of how shareholder proposals can have strong impact even with minority vote results. The proposal presented at Starbucks’ annual meeting had an impact even before voting results were complete. The day before its annual meeting, the company announced a $10 million investment in designing a more sustainable cup that can be recycled or composted globally, in an attempt to respond to one of the requests in the proposal."

Starbucks announced on Monday it plans to eliminate plastic straws from its 28,000 stores worldwide by 2020.

The company will broaden the manufacture and use of what some in social media have dubbed the ""adult sippy cup."" It's a plastic strawless lid that will come to replace single-use plastic straws that now inundate its coffee shops.

The company says the move, when fully implemented, could mean a billion fewer plastic straws across its stores each year. And it's a part of Starbucks' $10 million investment in creating recyclable and compostable cups around the world.

The strawless lid has already been in use at many of the company's stores for certain kinds of cold drinks like cold foam and ""draft nitro,"" the coffee drink that comes out of a keg, mixed with nitrogen. Unlike straws, the new lid can be recycled, the company said.

""For our partners and customers, this is a significant milestone to achieve our global aspiration of sustainable coffee, served to our customers in more sustainable ways,"" Kevin Johnson, president and chief executive officer for Starbucks, said in a statement.

Starbucks' headquarters are in Seattle, where a ban on plastic straws just kicked in.

Other chains are also experimenting with getting rid of straws. In June, McDonald's announced it would start phasing out plastic straws at about 1,300 restaurants in the United Kingdom and Ireland."

The coffee-shop giant announced Monday that it will use recyclable strawless lids and an alternative-material straw option in its more than 28,000 stores around the world. The move will eliminate more than 1 billion plastic straws per year from Starbucks stores, the company said.

""For our partners and customers, this is a significant milestone to achieve our global aspiration of sustainable coffee, served to our customers in more sustainable ways,"" Kevin Johnson, president and CEO of Starbucks, said in a statement.

The chain joins a growing number of companies making similar pledges, including Alaska Airlines, hotel chains Hilton and AccorHotels, cruise lines Royal Caribbean and Cunard, and food-service giant Bon Appetit Management, whose 1,000-plus locations in 33 states include universities and museums.

Last month, McDonald's announced that it would start testing plastic-straw alternatives at certain U.S. locations this year.

Americans use an estimated 500 million single-use straws daily, according to Eco-Cycle.

Starbucks' newly designed strawless lid will be used for all iced coffee, tea and espresso beverages. The environmentally friendly lid is now available in more than 8,000 of its stores in the U.S. and Canada for select beverages, including Draft Nitro and Cold Foam. Cold beverages now account for more than 50 percent of Starbucks' beverage mix in the U.S., up from 37 percent five years ago, the company said.

The coffee retailer will also begin offering straws made from alternative materials — including paper or compostable plastic — for Frappuccino beverages. These new straws will also be made available upon request to customers who prefer or need a straw, the company said.

Starting this fall, Starbucks customers in Seattle and Vancouver will be the first to receive the strawless lids, with phased roll-outs in the U.S. and Canada coming in fiscal year 2019. A global roll-out will follow, starting in Europe where the strawless lids will arrive in select stores in France, the Netherlands and the U.K.

A plastic-straw ban in Seattle, Starbucks' hometown, took effect July 1, making it the first major city to take action. Malibu, California; Miami Beach, Florida; and Monmouth Beach, New Jersey, also prohibit single-use sippers.

Other municipalities mulling over the same kind of measure include Portland and New York City; California is considering a statewide ban.

Fueling the movement is increased consumer environmentalism and concern about the many straws that end up polluting oceans and waterways.

Anti-straw activists often suggest using straws made of paper, metal or glass — or simply drinking without one. Among the big names advocating for straw bans are actor Adrian Grenier, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and actor Kendrick Sampson.

Grenier, best known for his role in the TV show Entourage, urged Starbucks at its March shareholders meeting in Seattle to take action.

""Starbucks taught the world how to drink coffee, and I firmly believe that Starbucks can teach the world how to make the environment its ultimate business partner,"" Grenier said. ""The siren is calling. I hope all of you will listen to her.""

An online petition calling on Starbucks to say goodbye to plastic straws has close to 150,000 signatures.

This isn't the first time Starbucks has considered the environmental effect its customers' waste has. In March, for example, the company announced a $10 million challenge to design a disposable coffee cup that is compostable.

Starting July 10, Starbucks will also add two new permanent additions to its cold coffee menu in the U.S. and Canada: Salted Cream Cold Foam Cold Brew, featuring a strawless lid; and Iced Vanilla Bean Coconutmilk Latte, which consists of vanilla bean and coconut milk shaken with ice, with shots of Starbucks' signature espresso poured on top.

While it's estimated that Canadians use nearly 60 million plastic straws per day, critics of these bans say they do little to curb ocean pollution. Others, however, argue every little bit helps when it comes to reducing our reliance on single, or one-time-use items."
https://time.com/5333451/starbucks-plastic-straw-alternative/,Starbucks Is Ditching Plastic Straws. Here Are 3 of the Most Common Alternatives,https://time.com,7/9/18,"Starbucks announced on Monday that it will abandon all plastic straws and replace them with common straw alternatives: cold cup strawless lids or, in the case of Frappuccinos, biodegradable paper straws.

The coffee chain’s decision comes after Seattle banned single-use plastic straws and utensils in an effort to reduce plastic pollution. San Fransisco and New York are eyeing similar proposals and even the United Kingdom announced plans to pass legislation to reduce plastic waste. Starbucks said in a press release that the move to replace straws from its roughly 28,000 stores will eliminate more than 1 billion straws a year.

About 275 million metric tons of plastic waste was generated in 192 coastal countries in 2010, with 4.8 to 12.7 million metric tons entering the ocean, according to a 2015 Science magazine report. According to a report by Swiss non-profit World Economic Forum, by the year 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. The potential harm of ocean waste, particularly from plastic straws, drew widespread attention after a 2015 YouTube video of a sea turtle with a straw up its nostril went viral. The clip now has over 30 million views.

Starbucks is the biggest company to make the environmentally friendly move and it’s expected that more companies will follow its lead and offer their own eco-friendly alternatives to plastic straws. Here are some of the most popular options available today:

Metal Straws

Considered the most eco-friendly option because of how long they can last, these re-usable straws come in aluminum, stainless steel and titanium and are rustproof. Metal straws often come with cleaning brushes or can be brought separately to maintain cleanliness. Many metal straws are also dishwasher safe, bendable and are also made to fit most tumblers and cups.

Recyclable Lids

Starbucks’s strawless lid design, which was created by engineer Emily Alexander, could be s model for other stores. In their press release, the company said that after several weeks of designing, they chose the lid that featured a teardrop-shaped opening about the size of a thumbprint, described as a “cleaner, less-ridged version of a hot cup lid.”

Biodegradable Paper Straws

Before plastic straws became the standard, paper straws were the most widely used. Non-profit environmental group For A Strawless Ocean advocated for the use of Aardvark biodegradable straws, which are said to decompose in 45-90 days. It is currently the most popular alternative at major retailers."
https://www.eater.com/2018/7/9/17548260/starbucks-ban-plastic-straw-2020,Starbucks Sippy Cups Will Replace Plastic Straws by 2020,https://www.eater.com,7/9/18,"It looks like the plastic straw may be going the way of the fax machine and fountain pen: Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee seller, announced plans to nix straws at all of its stores by 2020. The chain, with more than 28,000 locations, is officially the largest food company in the world to make this promise, and has the power and influence to spur other restaurants of all sizes to follow in its footsteps. Starbucks estimates that this move will eliminate the use of 1 billion plastic straws per year.

Starbucks says it will replace plastic straws with paper or compostable plastic straws for blended drinks like Frappuccinos. These alternative straws will be available by request for customers who need or wish to use a straw. Otherwise, for cold brew, nitro, and other iced drinks, the coffee company will offer strawless lids, which it designed and manufactures. Already in use at more than 8,000 Starbucks stores, these lids look exactly like the tops to adult sippy cups, and, curiously are also made of plastic. Still, environmentalists seem to be supporting Starbucks’ move.

Plastic straws are kind of like a gateway plastic for every day citizens. As the founder of strawfree.org told the New York Times: “I think a lot of people feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of the plastic problem … Giving up plastic straws is a small step, and an easy thing for people to get started on. From there, we can move on to larger projects.”

“For our partners and customers, this is a significant milestone to achieve our global aspiration of sustainable coffee, served to our customers in more sustainable ways,” Kevin Johnson, Starbucks president and CEO, said in a release.

Seattle and Vancouver-area Starbucks locations will be the first to go straw-free.

The now-ubiquitous straw-free movement seemed to come out of nowhere earlier this year. McDonald’s in the UK announced earlier this year that it would switch from plastic to paper straws by this fall, but its U.S. counterpart has yet to follow suit. Meanwhile, metropolitan areas across the country, from Malibu to Seattle, have already passed straw bans, and cities like Berkeley and New York are facing similar proposed legislation. Earlier this summer Lettuce Entertain You, a restaurant group out of Chicago, also said it would cease use of plastic straws at 120 of its locations.

Per a release, Starbucks also says it’s still working on a fully recyclable and compostable hot cup. The company is spending $10 million on the initiative, which is in partnership with Closed Loop Partners, through the NextGen Cup Consortium and Challenge.

Starbucks has announced it intends to eliminate the use of plastic straws in its shops by 2020.

The Seattle, Washington-based, global coffee giant is the largest company to announce a move that is part of a larger push for the business community to become more environmentally-friendly.

Once fully implemented, the policy will eliminate 1bn plastic straws per year from heading to landfills and play a part in saving the estimated 100,000 mammals who die each year from ingesting or getting tangled in plastic waste, particularly in the ocean and on beaches.

Recommended Starbucks employee fired for ridiculing customer with stammer

To facilitate phasing straws out, Starbucks locations will begin using different lids for cups.

Instead of flat ones with a slit for the straw, the lids will feature a raised lip to drink directly from.

For other drinks, like frappuccino drinks, the current plastic dome lid will remain in use, however, the straws used will be made from paper or other biodegradable material.

Michael Gove says he is exploring whether plastic straws can be banned

Customers will be able to request the new earth-friendly straws for other drinks as well.

Hot drinks will continue to be served with the usual strawless lids.

Since the city of Seattle outlawed plastic straws and utensils beginning last week, Starbucks will begin with stores there and in nearby Vancouver, Canada.

CEO Kevin Johnson called the effort a “significant milestone” in the path to sustainability.

Local governments around the country have followed suit to ban plastic straws or at least strongly encourage residents and businesses to use paper or biodegradable straws.

Cities in Florida in particular like Naples and Fort Myers have implemented such efforts to protect their coastline, eroding from environmental damage and climate change.

New York and San Francisco are considering bans similar to that of Seattle as well and though the discussion of large efforts towards sustainability has been taking place in boardrooms, Starbucks is the first major company to undertake it.

McDonald’s announced recently that it would only use paper straws in their UK and Ireland locations by 2019.

Shareholders voted down an effort to get a report about plastic straws across all locations, but the fast food icon said it would be testing plastic alternatives in select US stores.

Plastic straws comprise approximately four per cent of plastic trash when considering the number of pieces and add 2,000 tonnes to the annual 9 million tonnes of plastic waste which enters bodies of water."
https://apnews.com/article/7b78becf91e74ce8996561c7fbfb186f,"Starbucks, citing ocean threat, is ditching plastic straws",https://apnews.com,7/9/18,"NEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks will eliminate plastic straws from all of its locations within two years, the coffee chain announced Monday, becoming the largest food and beverage company to do so as calls for businesses and cities to cut waste grow louder.

While the straws account for a small percentage of the pollution that ends up in the ocean, they’ve become a flashpoint because they’re seen as an easy way to reduce waste.

“There are several of these single-use items the public is realizing, hey, we don’t actually need these,” said Denise Hardesty, a scientist with Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation who studies plastic pollution.

A week after its hometown of Seattle banned plastic drinking straws and utensils, Starbucks said Monday that by 2020, it will use straws made from biodegradable materials such as paper and specially designed lids. The company already offers alternative straws in Seattle.

Straws often become trash because their small size makes them difficult to recycle.

Other cities, like Fort Myers Beach in Florida, have banned plastic straws, and similar proposals are being considered in New York and San Francisco. The push to ban the straws gained traction after a viral video in 2015 showed rescuers removing a straw from a sea turtle’s nose in graphic detail.

The issue of waste more broadly is coming up in company boardrooms.

In February, Dunkin’ Donuts said it would eliminate polystyrene foam cups from its stores by 2020.

McDonald’s said it would switch to paper straws in the United Kingdom and Ireland by next year and test alternatives to plastic straws in some U.S. locations. The burger chain also said this year it would use only recycled or other environmentally friendly materials for its soda cups, Happy Meal boxes and other packaging by 2025.

Plastic drinking straws make up only about 4 percent of plastic trash by number of pieces, and far less by weight. Straws add up to about 2,000 tons of the nearly 9 million tons of plastic waste that ends up in waters around the globe each year.

Still, the advocacy group 5 Gyres notes that the top five biggest sources of single-use plastic are plastic bags, water bottles, to-go containers, to-go cups and straws.

Other plastic items have also been targeted in recent years.

Several local governments have enacted bans and fees on plastic bags. Reusable water bottles have also gained popularity as a way to reduce use of plastic water bottles, with refilling water stations popping up on college campuses and elsewhere.

One reason big chains say it will take time to change practices may be the difficulty in securing adequate supplies. Imperial Dade, a food service and janitorial supplies distributor based in New Jersey, says it’s seen a huge spike in demand for alternative straws in recent months.

“Our biggest challenge is trying to locate alternative sources so we can satisfy the demand,” said Laura Craven, the company’s director of marketing.

Craven also said she’s starting to see more awareness about the need for exemptions for straws that bend, which people with disabilities and others may need. Starbucks says it expects an alternative it has to work in that regard.

The strawless lids will begin to appear in Seattle and Vancouver Starbucks this fall, with phased rollouts within the U.S. and Canada next year. A global rollout of strawless lids will follow, beginning in Europe, where they will be used in some stores in France and the Netherlands, as well as in the United Kingdom."
https://money.com/starbucks-hyatt-ban-plastic-straws/,All the Major Companies That Are Banning Plastic Straws,https://money.com,7/9/18,"Americans use millions of straws every day. But that number could go down as more companies, like Starbucks, are pledging to ditch plastic, single-use straws.

American Airlines joined Starbucks and Hyatt announcing that they are phasing out the use of plastic straws globally. Plenty of companies in countries like the U.K. and Taiwan, such as McDonald's and Marriott International — which just announced an initiative to eliminate plastic straws worldwide — are ahead of their counterparts in the U.S. in terms of reducing their reliance on plastic. So while those who announced this week are not the first to pledge giving up plastic straws, they're certainly the biggest name brands in the U.S.

The corporate actions come amid increased public awareness about the dangers and damage caused by the eight metric tons of plastic that ends up in the ocean every single year. This is in part because of recent social media campaigns using celebrities to ask people to stop using plastic, as well as a viral video of a sea turtle having a plastic straw extracted from its nostrils that has been viewed more than 30 million times on YouTube.

Here are other U.S. companies, states and cities that have pledged to phase out the use of plastic straws:

Starbucks

For an international company like Starbucks, phasing out single-use plastic straws from its more than 28,000 stores around the world will eliminate the use of 1 billion straws every single year. The coffee giant is replacing straws with newly designed recyclable lids that will ""become standard on most iced drinks,"" according to a press release from the company. It's a big deal given 50% of Starbucks sales in 2017 came from cold beverages, a 13% increase from five years ago.

The new lids are already being used for some Starbucks drinks in 8,000 stores in the U.S. and Canada. While the new lids will still be made of plastic, they will be comprised of polypropylene, which ""can be widely recycled,"" according to the company.

“This move is an answer to our own partners about what we can do to reduce the need for straws,” said Colleen Chapman, vice president of Starbucks global social impact overseeing sustainability in the release. “Not using a straw is the best thing we can do for the environment.”

Customers who still want or need to use straws will still be able to request them — but they won't be made out of plastic. Starbucks started testing straws made from alternative materials last year in California, and is currently trying out paper straws in U.K. stores, the release says.

Disney

Disney announced it would eliminate single-use plastic straws and stirrers at all their locations by mid-2019. The only exception will be Tokyo Disney, Which is operated by The Oriental Land Company, according to the company's website.

The company will also cut back on single use plastic bags and transition to in-room reusable amenities in hotels and cruise ships as a way to continue their ""commitment to environmental stewardship [that] goes back to to our founding,"" Dr. Mark Penning, Vice President, Animals, Science and Environment, Disney Parks wrote in a Disney Parks blogpost.

Disney estimates that it will reduce their annual plastic footprint by 175 million plastic straws and 13 million stirrers. They also said it is their goal to eventually operate with zero waste and zero green house gas emissions.

Hyatt

Hyatt announced that plastic straws and drink picks will only be available by request after September 1 of this year. The company said ""eco-friendly alternatives will be provided where available"" in a press release. Hyatt introduced its ""2020 Environmental Sustainability Vision"" four years ago, making commitments to more sustainable practices, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25% (compared to 2006 levels) across all regions, and offering reusable earbuds rather than single-use ones in its North American fitness centers, according to the release.

The worldwide hotel chain also works with Clean the World, a non-profit that collects and donates unused bath products from the hotels and distributes them to communities in need.

American Airlines

American Airlines announced Tuesday it would eliminate plastic straws from its lounges and replace them with biodegradable, eco-friendly straws and wood stir sticks starting in July. In a statement, the airline said it will also transition to eco-friendly flatware within lounges and that starting in November, it will transition from a plastic straw and stir stick that is usually offered during onboard beverage to a stir stick made of sustainable and environmentally friendly bamboo.

These changes will eliminate more than 71,000 pounds of plastic per year, according to the airline.

“We’re very excited and proud to share this initiative with our team members and customers,” Jill Surdek, Vice President of Flight Service, said in a statement. “We’re cognizant of our impact on the environment and we remain committed to doing our part to sustain the planet for future generations of travelers.”

Alaska Airlines

Alaska Airlines partnered with the non-profit Lonely Whale in May to replace plastic straws and citrus picks with ""sustainable alternatives in its airport lounges and on all domestic and international commercial flights"" starting in July 2018. In 2017, Alaska Airlines gave out more than 22 million plastic straws and citrus picks. Those items will be replaced with white birch stir sticks and a ""bamboo alternative"" for the citrus picks.

Bon Appétit

Bon Appétit said in May it is banning all plastic straws and stirrers in 1,000 restaurants in 33 states, and expects to have them completely phased out by 2019. The food service management company bought almost 17 million plastic straws in 2017.

SeaWorld Entertainment

In June, SeaWorld announced that plastic straws and shopping bags would be eliminated from its 12 theme parks, including Busch Gardens, as ""part of its mission to protect animals and habitats worldwide.""

Royal Caribbean

The cruise line said in June that it would stop providing plastic straws on its 50 cruise ships by the end of 2018.

Marriott International

In late July, Marriott International announced it would completely eliminate plastic straws and stirrers from its properties worldwide by 2019. The company estimated it uses about 1 billion straws and 250 million stirrers per year across more than 6,5000 locations. Marriott began phasing out plastic straws overseas earlier this year, ditching the plastic drinking utensils from its hotels in London in February.

States and Cities

It's not just companies that are phasing out the use of plastic straws. Cities and states are taking action to reduce their negative impact on the environment as well; Seattle became the first big U.S. city to ban the use of plastic straws, beginning July 1 this year.

California is exploring the possibility of banning plastic straws using Assembly Bill 1884, which would prohibit food facilities from ""providing single-use plastic straws...to consumers unless requested by the consumer."" If passed, the bill would be backed up by small fines to the offending facilities. Cities in the state have also started banning straws, with places like Malibu, Oakland and Berkley already instating straw rules.

Hawaii is also contemplating passing a bill to ban plastic straws, and two hotels there have already stopped using them in favor of paper straws.

On the East Coast, New Jersey's Monmouth Beach approved banning both plastic straws and bags, while in New York City a bill to ban plastic straws was introduced in May. In Florida, Miami Beach, Fort Myers Beach and St. Petersburg have all banned plastic straws.

Correction: The original version of this story said incorrectly that Fort Myers, Fla., was one of the cities that banned plastic straws. It is Fort Myers Beach, not Fort Myers."

The company cited the environmental threat to oceans posed by the single-use products as its motivating factor to accomplish this goal by 2020.

The switch is expected to eliminate the use of more than 1 billion plastic straws each year, according to estimates by Starbucks Coffee Co.

To carry out this change, Starbucks will make a strawless lid or alternative material straw options available for certain drinks at more than 28,000 stores.

'For our partners and customers, this is a significant milestone to achieve our global aspiration of sustainable coffee, served to our customers in more sustainable ways,' Kevin Johnson, president and chief executive officer for Starbucks, said in a statement posted to the company's website.

The strawless lid is already available in over 8,000 stores in the US and Canada for select beverages, including Starbucks Draft Nitro and Cold Foam.

It is now being piloted for Nitro beverages in China, Japan, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, and will become the company's standard for all iced coffee, tea and espresso beverages.

Straws made out of paper or compostable plastic, for use with Frappuccino blended beverages, will also be available by request for customers who prefer or need a straw.

Starbucks said cold drinks that have previously typically included a straw make up 50 per cent of its beverages sold at this time.

This number is up from just 37 per cent of beverage sales, five years ago.

The company's announcement comes one week after it's flagship city, Seattle, banned single-use plastic straws and utensils at businesses that sell food or drinks within its limits.

Starbucks' Seattle and Vancouver locations will be the first to roll out the change.

With this move, the business becomes the largest food and beverage company operating globally to commit to this policy, it said."

Starting in September, hotel visitors will have to request single-use plastic straw and drink picks, while eco-friendly alternatives will be provided where available, Hyatt said Monday in a news release.

The move by the Chicago-based company, which operates some 700 hotels in more than 50 countries, comes as Starbucks announced Monday that it would get rid of plastic straws from all its 28,000 global locations by 2020.

Other companies are also taking action. Royal Caribbean said last month that its 50 cruise ships would no longer carry plastic straws starting in 2019, with SeaWorld and Ikea also vowing to eliminate plastic. The moves were made only weeks after a pilot whale that died off the coast of Thailand was found with 17 pounds of plastic bags in its stomach. Another Seattle-based company, Alaska Airlines, in May said it would use compostable stir straws and citrus picks on its flights.

Cities around the world are joining in the campaign as well. Seattle, where Starbucks in based, last week became the first U.S. metropolis to ban plastic drink straws and utensils, and similar proposals are under consideration in New York and San Francisco. A ban on plastic straws took effect in in February on Florida's Fort Meyers Beach.

Vancouver has said it would ban plastic straws, foam cups and containers by June 2019, and Scotland also plans to get rid of plastic straws as soon next year. Taiwan is banning single-use plastic products, including straws and shopping bags, by 2030. Britain plans to ban plastic straws and cotton swabs as soon as 2019.

McDonald's, on the other hand, is trying out paper straws in the U.K., but shareholders at the fast-food chain's annual meeting in May rejected a proposal to study a ban in the U.S."
https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/starbucks-environment-bans-plastic-straws-2020/,"Starbucks, Citing Environment, To Stop Offering Plastic Straws By 2020",https://www.cbsnews.com,7/9/18,"SEATTLE (CBSDFW.COM/AP) — Starbucks says it will eliminate plastic straws from its stores globally by 2020, a nod to the growing push for businesses to be more environmentally friendly.

The company will become the largest food and beverage company operating globally to ban plastic straws from all of its stores.

The Seattle-based company said Monday it will instead use straws made from other materials, and lids designed not to need straws. McDonald's also recently said it would switch to paper straws in the United Kingdom and Ireland by next year, and test alternatives to plastic straws in some U.S. locations.

Environmental activists have been pressuring businesses to ditch plastic straws because they can end up in the ocean and hurt marine life. The push gained traction after a viral video in 2015 showed rescuers removing a straw from a sea turtle's nose in graphic detail.

Local governments have also been looking at the issue. Last week, Seattle's ban on single-use plastic straws and utensils in food service outlets took effect, and Starbucks says it already offers alternative straws there. Similar proposals are being considered elsewhere, including New York and San Francisco.

Starbucks said Monday that it is making available a strawless lid at 8,000 stores in the U.S. and Canada for certain drinks.

Starbucks Coffee Co. estimates the switch will eliminate more than 1 billion plastic straws a year. Starbucks said cold beverages in which a straw is typically included make up 50 percent of the drinks its sells, up from just 37 percent five years ago.

While straws have become a high-profile issue, they make up only about 4 percent of the plastic trash by number of pieces, and far less by weight. Straws add up to only about 2,000 tons of the nearly 9 million tons of plastic waste that hits waters a year.

Still, those who support limiting plastic straws say they are generally unnecessary and a ban is good symbol.

Just don’t use paper ones, because they’re awful",https://qz.com,7/9/18,"The announcement from Starbucks that the coffee chain will phase out plastic drinking straws in all locations by 2020 expands the roster of places worldwide that have banned the once-ubiquitous disposable item. This is probably good for the environment (though certainly no panacea to solve the problem of ocean plastic).

But as we face a future without plastic straws, one thing is certain: We must not allow the chaos and uncertainty of these times to give rise to an age of paper straws.

Paper straws, which are already ubiquitous in some countries, do not deserve to carry the name “straw,” in the sense of a tool that can be trusted to convey liquid to one’s mouth using the forces of suction. Paper straws undermine the good intentions behind their creation, solving the problem of one single-use disposable with another single-use disposable—and leaving otherwise environmentally-minded folk dependent on the straw, when no straw at all is clearly the better option. Paper straws are an abomination.

Never sipped a beverage from a paper straw? Reach for the closest piece of paper at hand—the back cover of that two-month-old Economist you swear you’re going to read, an aging flier for guitar lessons pinned up at a coffee shop—and roll it into a thin tube. Sip a variety of beverages through it so that you can marvel at how all drinks—fizzy sodas, fresh-squeezed juices, refreshing cocktails of all stripes—take the flavor of wet paper under the tyrannical influence of this drinking straw imposter. Enjoy the mouthfeel of cellulose dissolving on your tongue.

Paper straws are not analogous to swapping reusable shopping bags for disposable ones, or even swapping paper for plastic bags. They are more like carrying water home in a paper boat made by a child. They are like transporting rice in a fishing net. They are not fit for the purpose and we must not cede counter space to them in our places of refreshment.

This is not a situation in which we should search for answers in the past. Would those who suggest that we sip from mushy straws also have us return to leeching?

Plastic straws exist in the first place as a solution to paper’s glaring flaws. The original packaged drinking straws were made of rye grass, an entirely biodegradable product that left an earthen taste in drinkers’ mouths and decayed plant matter at the bottom of their cups. Starting in the late 19th century, inventor Marvin C. Stone’s patented paper straw dominated the soda fountain market. That is until plastic’s rise in the 1960s finally gave consumers a clean, efficient straw.

Superior non-plastic alternatives exist from a performance standpoint—glass, metal, some compostable corn-based thing—though their high cost and impracticality means they pose no real challenge to paper or plastic’s cheap disposability. It is time to rethink our relationship to straws and beverages altogether. The question to ask is not paper or plastic; it’s do you need a straw at all?

Frappuccinos, yes, are hard to consume without a straw. And the symbiotic relationship between bubble tea and see-through straws is so strong that it is hard to imagine the former’s continued existence without the latter. I don’t know what people are supposed to do about bubble tea.

But does a cocktail need a straw? Do most beverages, when consumed seated with minimal risk of spillage? Can’t iced coffees and teas be as easily sipped through the same one-piece lid through which we enjoy hot drinks on the go? And actually, do we need to be constantly purchasing beverages when we are out and about?

The straw debate is not really about straws. It’s about the broader effects of a culture of thoughtless consumption and disposal. To consider whether to take a straw is to be conscious, even for a fleeting moment, of the resources it takes to prop up the illusion that life is cheap or convenient. To decline one is to recognize in some small way that changing the course of the planet’s degradation will require us to give up some things we once took for granted, and reminds us that the environmental calamities we bemoan are in part a result of our own choices and preferences.

Plastic straws could disappear from the face of the earth tomorrow and there would still be too much plastic in the sea. But we must start somewhere. Use fewer or no straws. And do not suck on a paper straw, ever. It’s gross."

In February, Dunkin’ Donuts said it would eliminate polystyrene foam cups from its stores by 2020.

McDonald’s shareholders voted down a proposal requesting a report on plastic straws in May. But the burger chain recently said it would switch to paper straws in the United Kingdom and Ireland by next year, and test alternatives to plastic straws in some U.S. locations.

McDonald’s also said this year that it would use only recycled or other environmentally friendly materials for its soda cups, Happy Meal boxes and other packaging by 2025.

One reason big chains say it will take time to change may be the difficulty in securing adequate supplies. Imperial Dade, a foodservice and janitorial supplies distributor based in New Jersey, says it’s seen a huge spike in demand for alternative straws in recent months.

“Our biggest challenge is trying to locate alternative sources so we can satisfy the demand,” said Laura Craven, the company’s director of marketing.

While plastic drinking straws have become one of the more high-profile environmental issues, they make up only about 4 percent of the plastic trash by number of pieces, and far less by weight. Straws add up to about 2,000 tons of the nearly 9 million tons of plastic waste that ends up in waters around the globe each year.

The advocacy group 5 Gyres notes that the top five biggest sources of single-use plastic are plastic bags, water bottles, to-go containers, to-go cups and straws.

The strawless lids will begin to appear in Seattle and Vancouver Starbucks this fall, with phased rollouts within the U.S. and Canada next year.

To give you an idea, this is enough to circle the Earth twice — or fill 125 school buses. And because disposable plastic straws aren’t recyclable, they tend to end up in landfills, oceans or the environment. It’s a massive, growing problem contributing to the 8 million tons of plastic dumped into the ocean every year — and Starbucks is taking action to help reduce its use of them.

Today, Starbucks announced it will eliminate single-use plastic straws globally from all 28,000 stores by 2020, replacing them with a new recyclable strawless lid as well as eco-friendly straw options. By doing so, Starbucks hopes to eliminate more than 1 billion plastic straws per year from its stores.

“Starbucks’ goal to eliminate plastic straws by 2020 from their stores globally represents the company’s forward thinking in tackling the material waste challenge in totality,” says Erin Simon, director of sustainability research and development and material science at World Wildlife Fund, in a press release. “Plastic straws that end up in our oceans have a devastating effect on species. As we partner with Starbucks in waste reduction initiatives such as Next Gen Consortium Cup Challenge and WWF’s Cascading Materials Vision, we hope others will follow in their footsteps.”

As part of its $10 million commitment to develop a recyclable and compostable cup solution, you’ll find the new strawless lid — or “adult sippy cups” — on all Starbucks’ iced coffee, tea and espresso drinks. The lid is already available in more than 8,000 stores in the U.S. and Canada.

For those who do want a straw, though, you can ask the barista for a recyclable straw, which is made with paper or compostable plastic. And don’t worry, all Frappuccinos will come equipped with one of these alternative-material straws.

“Starbucks decision to phase out single-use plastic straws is a shining example of the important role that companies can play in stemming the tide of ocean plastic. With eight million metric tons of plastic entering the ocean every year, we cannot afford to let industry sit on the sidelines, and we are grateful for Starbucks leadership in this space,” says Nicholas Mallos, director of Ocean Conservancy’s Trash Free Seas program, in the press release.

If you’re in Seattle or Vancouver, the strawless lids will be implemented starting this fall. The rest of the stores in the U.S. and Canada will be next, in 2019; then, the global rollout will begin, starting in France, the Netherlands and the U.K. — where stores in the area have already implemented a 5 pence paper cup charge to promote reusability and will expand to 950 more stores later this month.

While Starbucks is the largest food and beverage retailer to make this a commitment, they aren’t the first. In June, McDonald’s announced it would start phasing out plastic straws at about 1,300 restaurants in the U.K. and Ireland. And the entire city of Seattle banned the use of plastic straws and utensils in bars and restaurants this month in an effort to reduce waste. This is the first major U.S. city to do so, and the city ban affects its 5,000 restaurants. Other major cities, including New York and San Francisco, are considering doing the same.

https://www.papermag.com/starbucks-plastic-straws,Starbucks to Ditch Plastic Straws,https://www.papermag.com,7/9/18,"A few weeks after its hometown of Seattle banned plastic straws citywide, Starbucks announced plans to remove the environmental menaces from its more than 28,000 stores for good. The coffee giant said in an announcement that it will be ""strawless"" by 2020, which it estimates will eliminate more than one billion plastic straws per year.

Starbucks will instead serve its iced coffee, tea, blended drinks and other frappuccino-adjacent treats with strawless lids made specially to reduce spillage. These lids are already available in 8,000 locations in the U.S. and Canada, where its strawless-lid rollout will continue before moving onto Europe.

The company also announced it will introduce alternative-material straws for some beverages, which may be helpful to disabled people who require straws to drink independently (though advocates have said that non-plastic materials do not provide the same usability as plastic). This will also appeal to the celebs and fashionable people of the world who can't stand the thought of coffee staining their pearly whites.

Starbucks is of course far from the only company to reduce straw use; major chains like McDonald's, Burger King U.K., Ikea and Alaska Airlines are also working on ditching plastic. Awareness of the damage plastic straws, which typically aren't recycle and instead degrade into microplastics later ingested by sea life, has increased rapidly in the past year and a worldwide movement to end their use is picking up steam. Starbucks' move to ban them is a big step in the right direction.

Unveiling photographs of a new lid cup design today, the world’s largest beverage chain estimates that it will save a billion straws each year.

Many sustainability experts and environment advocates cheered Starbuck’s planet-saving initiative as a significant milestone in the campaign to combat the 8 million metric tons of new plastic waste entering the world’s oceans each year.

But in the bid to design alternatives to straws, there’s one oft-ignored population that will be negatively affected when the much-maligned drinking devices aren’t so readily available. For many people with physical disabilities, straws “are vital for independent living.”

Writing on the Greenpeace blog, Jamie Szymkowiak, co-founder of the Scottish disability rights nonprofit One in Five, explains why disposable plastic straws, for the time being, is still the best option for many people with disabilities:

A soggy paper straw increases the risk of choking. Most paper and silicone alternatives are not flexible, and this is an important feature for people with mobility related impairments. Metal, glass and bamboo straws present obvious dangers for people who have difficulty controlling their bite, as well as those with neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s. Some disabled people use straws when drinking coffee or eating soup, yet most of the alternatives, including the leading biodegradable straw, are not suitable for drinks over 40°C. In addition, re-useable straws in public places are not always hygienic or easy to clean.

To Szymkowiak’s point, bendy plastic straws were originally used as adaptive technology in hospitals. In the late 1940s, inventor Joseph B. Friedman sold the disposable “Flex-Straw” (or “personalized drinking tube”) as a tool to help reclined patients drink from a cup. As the Flex-Straw advertisement shows, they were sanitary, cheap, sturdy, temperature-resistant and suited for children and epilepsy patients.

Friedman’s genius invention—initially devised to help his young daughter sip a milkshake on her own—is championed as an icon of ”universal design”—a principle that ensures that all designed objects and systems are accessible and pleasing to everyone regardless of age, economic status or physical abilities.

Szymkowiak clarifies that meeting the requirements of disabled populations doesn’t need to kill the planet. He suggests that instead of banishing straws altogether, companies should continue researching wisely-designed alternatives that will work for everyone. ”As we move to ridding our oceans, beaches and parks of unnecessary single-use plastics, disabled people shouldn’t be used as a scapegoat by large corporations, or governments, unwilling to push suppliers and manufacturers to produce a better solution,” he writes. “We must all work together to demand an environmentally friendly solution that meets all our needs, including those of disabled people.”

(Why not tomorrow?)

The move follows a ban on plastic straws and utensils in Starbucks’ home city of Seattle that took effect July 1, and it carries a $250 fine for any restaurants caught using single-use plastic.

Starbucks — which is replacing straws with a proprietary, recyclable alternative plastic lid that looks and functions like a sippy cup — took the opportunity to pat itself on the back and declare the moment a fine example of corporate responsibility.

“By nature, the straw isn’t recyclable and the lid is, so we feel this decision is more sustainable and more socially responsible,” said Chris Milne, director of packaging sourcing for Starbucks. “Starbucks is finally drawing a line in the sand and creating a mold for other large brands to follow. We are raising the water line for what’s acceptable and inspiring our peers to follow suit.”

While Starbucks does post some big numbers in terms of drinks sales and straw usage, switching from single-use straws to recyclable (depending on the market) polypropylene lids is a tiny drop in a vast ocean in terms of curbing marine plastic pollution.

Among the many misunderstandings and conundrums associated with recycling plastic, consider these: 1) The world’s number one recycler of plastic, China, has refused to accept more plastic from the Western world; 2) The vast majority of the plastic that is recycled ends up as content for another single-use product that winds up in landfills or in the environment; 3) Only approximately 9 percent of plastic is recycled in the first place; the list goes on.

It is as if the recycling of plastic never had a chance as a viable method for reducing the amount of plastic entering landfills or being returned to the natural environment, often in the form of microplastics that find their way to ocean beds to choke out marine life.

Yet here we are in 2018, and straws are being singled out as a prime culprit of environmental degradation, particularly in the coffee industry, where plastic and polystyrene foam (styrofoam) for decades helped pave the way for a high-volume drinks sales model.

Why straws? There are some truths and half-truths floating around about the particular size of straws and their ability to escape recycling streams. Numerous nonprofit environmental organizations have singled out the suckers as villains, creating a small movement that has resulted in such policy decisions as recently expressed in Seattle and other municipalities in California and Florida, in bans in small cafes and bars, and in corporate policy decisions throughout the hospitality sector.

One popular theory is that straws represent a kind of “gateway plastic” that can help corporations and consumers be more aware of their usage of nonbiodegradable products.

“As our team explored the myriad options of plastic pollution to find the perfect entry point to incent behavior change, we found plastic water bottles too endemic, plastic bags already somewhat politicized, and no viable alternative for the plastic cup in ALL markets,” Dune Ives, executive director of the Lonely Whale Foundation, wrote in a recent column for Wildlife Conservation International.

In a sense, Starbucks’ announcement is a learned behavior change. In today’s announcement, Colleen Chapman, the vice president of Starbucks global social impact, said eliminating straws is “a response to requests from partners and customers.”

Unfortunately, Chapman added, “Not using a straw is the best thing we can do for the environment.”

Let’s not get carried away. While Starbucks should be commended for taking the lead among global chain retailers of coffee, this is a mere baby step up a steep, tall mountain made of single-use waste."

Instead of the longtime drinking tool, the company will provide strawless lids, which will become the new standard for iced coffee, tea and espresso beverages. Through this decision, the company expects to eliminate more than one billion plastic straws annually from Starbucks stores.

If the new lid idea sounds familiar, perhaps you've already used one. Thousands of Starbucks stores in the United States and Canada have already put the strawless lids to work, using them for the Starbucks Draft Nitro and Cold Foam.

For the beverages that customers might still want a straw—like Frappuccinos— Starbucks will begin offering straws made from alternative materials like paper and compostable plastic by request.

Starbucks notes the cups for its cold drinks are made from recyclable materials.

While plastic drinking straws have become one of the more high-profile issues environmentally, they make up only about 4 percent of the plastic trash by number of pieces, and far less by weight. Straws add up to about 2,000 tons of the nearly 9 million tons of plastic waste that ends up in the water each year.

The strawless lids will begin to appear in Seattle and Vancouver Starbucks this fall, with phased rollouts within the U.S. and Canada to follow next year. A global rollout of the strawless lids will follow, beginning in Europe where the will be used in select stores in France and the Netherlands, as well as in the United Kingdom.

Environmental activists have been pressuring businesses to ditch plastic straws because they can end up in the ocean and hurt marine life. The push gained traction after a viral video in 2015 showed rescuers removing a straw from a sea turtle's nose in graphic detail.

Still, the advocacy group 5 Gyres notes that the top five biggest sources of single-use plastic are plastic bags, water bottles, to-go containers, to-go cups and straws.

Other plastic items have also been targeted in recent years.

Several local governments have enacted bans and fees on plastic bags. Reusable water bottles have also gained popularity as a way to reduce use of plastic water bottles, with refilling water stations popping up on college campuses and elsewhere.

One reason big chains say it will take time to change practices may be the difficulty in securing adequate supplies. Imperial Dade, a food service and janitorial supplies distributor based in New Jersey, says it's seen a huge spike in demand for alternative straws in recent months.

""Our biggest challenge is trying to locate alternative sources so we can satisfy the demand,"" said Laura Craven, the company's director of marketing.

Craven also said she's starting to see more awareness about the need for exemptions for straws that bend, which people with disabilities and others may need. Starbucks says it expects an alternative it has to work in that regard.

Starbucks is still on track to phase out plastic straws from all 30,000-plus of its stores worldwide by 2020 with seven more markets making the switch by August 2019. In mid July, stores in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle transitioned to the sippy cup-style lids initially designed for Starbucks’ Draft Nitro drink. Washington, D.C., San Diego, Indianapolis, and Toronto will follow suit in August.

The new lid has 9 percent less plastic than the current lid and straw served at most Starbucks, the brand says. It will be used on all iced drinks except Frappuccinos, which will come with a straw made from paper or PLA compostable plastic made from sustainable materials. People who prefer or need a straw can still request one; the ones given out will be made with plant-based or other sustainable materials.

ORIGINAL POST: July 09, 2018 at 6:58 a.m.



Back in 2016, Starbucks began serving coffee with strawless lids at Seattle's Reserve Roastery. The 'sippy cups,' as the internet so lovingly dubbed them, have started to roll out across the country with Starbucks' new cold-foam topped drinks. In the next few years, you can expect to see a lot more of 'em. The coffee giant announced today a global effort to eliminate single-use plastic straws by 2020, and the new lids are a major player in making that happen.

Starbucks

Currently available at more than 8,000 stores in the U.S. and Canada, the lids will be phased in to every Starbucks in Seattle and Vancouver this fall, with more regions following suit.

If you're already panicking over how to drink your beloved Frapp — don't freak out. The iconic green straw will still be available, but in a new material. Instead of using single-use plastic straws, Starbucks is switching over to paper and compostable plastic straws, served with Frappuccinos and available upon request for customer ""who prefer or need a straw,"" per the company.



Along with announcing the environmentally-friendly decision — it's said to save 1 billion straws per year — Starbucks announced two new drinks rolling out tomorrow. Starting Tuesday, July 10, U.S. and Canadian menus will feature a Salted Cream Cold Foam Cold Brew (served with a strawless lid) and an Iced Vanilla Bean Coconutmilk Latte. The latter uses vanilla bean and coconutmilk shaken with ice and shots of espresso, which makes is less calorie-dense than other lattes. Since there's no syrup, there's also less sugar.

Starbucks

Starbucks' effort to go strawless is one of many from companies and cities hoping to reduce waste and keep straws from ending up in the ocean, where they can hurt wildlife. Last week, Seattle announced it is the first city to ban plastic straws and utensils."

While Australia still comes to grips with the single-use plastic bag ban adopted by supermarkets Woolworths and Coles and other retailers , plastic straws have become another battleground for companies looking to reduce waste.

""There are several of these single-use items the public is realising, hey, we don't actually need these,"" said Denise Hardesty, a scientist with Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation who studies plastic pollution.

Starbucks has become the first major food and beverage company to ditch plastic straws. Picture: AAP (AAP)

A week after its hometown of Seattle banned plastic drinking straws and utensils, Starbucks said that by 2020 it will use straws made from biodegradable materials such as paper and specially designed lids. The company already offers alternative straws in Seattle.

Straws often become rubbish because their small size makes them difficult to recycle.

Plastic drinking straws make up only about 4 percent of plastic rubbish by number of pieces, and far less by weight. Straws add up to about 2000 tonnes of the nearly 9 million tons of plastic waste that ends up in waters around the globe each year.

The issue of waste more broadly is coming up in company boardrooms. In February, Dunkin' Donuts said it would eliminate polystyrene foam cups from its stores by 2020.

McDonald's said it would switch to paper straws in the United Kingdom and Ireland by next year and test alternatives to plastic straws in some US locations. The burger chain also said this year it would use only recycled or other environmentally friendly materials for its soda cups, Happy Meal boxes and other packaging by 2025.

The Seattle-based coffee chain said that it will eliminate single-use plastic straws in all of its 28,000 stores by 2020, an announcement that comes on the heels of Seattle’s passage of a citywide ban on plastic straws (as well as utensils) that went into effect at the beginning of this month.

So, who's next?

“When one major company does something, that kind of puts pressure on the others. No restaurant wants to be known as the last one to use Styrofoam packaging,” said Caleb Bryant, senior beverage analyst at Mintel.

In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for Burger King said that the brand would begin its rollout of biodegradable straws in the U.K. this September. In response to a question about if or when the brand would expand the initiative into locations where it is not legally mandated, she said, “We look forward to sharing more updates in the near future.”

McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook told CNBC last month that the issue of disposable plastic was “on everyone’s radar,” but said the fast food chain had no plans to ditch plastic altogether. ""There isn't currently a viable alternative that's nonplastic at the moment, at the scale we need,” he said.

Alaska Airlines announced in May that it will stop using plastic coffee stirrers and citrus picks, part of a larger set of sustainability goals. (The airline said it used 22 billion of them last year.)

Bon Appetit Management Company, a foodservice management company that services colleges, corporations and cultural institutions at 1,000 locations across the U.S., recently announced that it would stop serving plastic straws in the facilities it manages, spurred by a decision from the University of Portland, one of its clients, to do away with single-use plastic straws.

“Our first choice is to have straws only by request,” said Maisie Ganzler, chief strategy and brand officer for the company. Ganzler said the company is bringing in paper straws and experimenting with ones made from hay and bamboo.

The move away from plastic straws is part of a growing awareness of the effect that the eight million metric tons of plastic that are dumped into the world’s oceans each year have on marine life.

Social media has helped play a role in raising awareness. A video of a plastic straw being removed from the nose of a rescued sea turtle went viral. Actor and activist Adrian Grenier of Entourage has taken to replying to the Instagram photos of fellow celebrities using plastic straws with comments like ""#stopsucking.""

In a report on sustainability practices, the National Restaurant Association said that 45 percent of customers consider environmentally friendly packaging to be an important factor they consider when making a choice of where to dine.

Although alternatives like paper or compostable straws are more expensive than their plastic counterparts, Darren Tristano, CEO of foodservice industry consulting firm CHD Expert said the ultimate economic impact for Starbucks might be a wash, as straw usage overall declines over time. Unlike other restaurant chains that are swapping in straws made of paper or plastic-like compostable materials, Starbucks has gone a step further, pioneering the use of recyclable cold drink lids that don’t need to be used with a straw and investing $10 million in developing a recyclable, compostable hot-drink cup.

There also is the financial cost to consider. “The paper straws are significantly more expensive than the plastic,” Ganzler said. She wouldn’t say how much the shift away from plastic was costing Bon Appetit, but she said she expects both product and distribution costs for non-plastic straws to fall as their usage becomes more widespread throughout the industry.

But despite the cost, it’s only a matter of time before other brands follow Starbucks’ lead, said Tristano.

“I would expect to see McDonalds, Wendy's and Dunkin Donuts following suit and making some changes in regions of the U.S. that are most environmentally conscious… and also near the ocean or lakes where wildlife can be affected by the debris and pollution,” he said."
https://newrepublic.com/article/149704/starbucks-straw-ban-environmental-milestone,Why Starbucks’ Straw Ban Is an Environmental Milestone,https://newrepublic.com,7/10/18,"Starbucks says its new strawless lid “is made from polypropylene, a commonly-accepted recyclable plastic that can be captured in recycling infrastructure.” Starbucks

The fact that Starbucks is replacing its plastic straws with denser plastic lids has also spurred concerns that the company is still using roughly same amount of plastic in its packaging, if not more. But Starbucks has argued that its new lids will be much easier to recycle than plastic straws. “By nature, the straw isn’t recyclable and the lid is, so we feel this decision is more sustainable and more socially responsible,” Starbucks’ director of packaging sourcing said in a statement. As Sam Athey, a plastics pollution researcher, explained to the The New York Times, “Plastic straws are pretty small and lightweight, so when they’re going through the mechanical sorter, they’re often lost or diverted.” And once straws slip through the cracks and get into the environment, it takes about 200 years for them to break down. “The straw was never recyclable,” Nuñez said. “The significance of the lid is that now you’ve got one item instead of two, formed in a shape that could potentially be recycled.”

The key word is “potentially”: Most recyclable plastic is never actually recycled. “The global recycling rate is less than 10 percent for plastic,” said Julie Andersen, the global executive director of Plastic Oceans Foundation. And the biggest flows of plastic into the oceans are coming not from America, but Southeast Asia and India, where cities don’t have robust trash and recycling systems. That’s why many ocean cleanup advocates say inadequate waste management, not the widespread use of plastic, is the biggest obstacle to preventing ocean plastic pollution.

But advocates also say companies like Starbucks share a responsibility, with governments, to improve recycling practices around the world. “All industries should be accountable for the plastic waste they create,” Andersen said. In Germany, for example, a whopping 65 percent of waste is recycled—and that’s partially because companies that sell plastic products must pay into the recycling system for the amount of plastic they put out. “As soon as [Germany] did that, the industry came up with ways to reduce the plastic they were producing,” Andersen said. “Personally,” she added, “I’ve never been to a Starbucks where they have a big recycling bin.” (Starbucks reportedly has front-of-store recycling in 50 percent of its company-owned stores.)"

A year ago, the coffee giant committed to eliminating its iconic green straws from stores worldwide by 2020.

As a substitute, the chain designed straw-less lids, which were originally offered at select locations in the U.S. and Canada, for its cold beverages.

Starbucks

Earlier this month, Starbucks announced that cafés in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Indianapolis, San Diego, Toronto and Washington, D.C. will all be joining be new cool cup club this summer — in other words, stores in those cities will no longer be offering plastic straws to customers.

This summer we're rolling out lightweight, recyclable strawless lids in select cities with more to follow in 2020.

The straw-less lid will become the standard for all iced coffee, iced tea and iced espresso beverages served in the 30,000-plus Starbucks locations around the globe by 2020, says the chain. For those who prefer sipping over gulping, stores will also offer straws made from alternative materials, such as paper or compostable plastic.

When it first made the anti-plastic pledge in 2018, Starbucks became the largest food and beverage retailer to join in on the growing movement to halt plastic straw usage and eliminate waste produced by so much plastic consumption. About a billion Starbucks straws are still used every year, according to the company.

But Starbucks isn't the only company trying to address this global issue.

Last summer, McDonald's in the U.K. announced that it would be getting rid of plastic straws in all of its stores by the end of 2019, and in May IKEA said it would remove plastic items like straws, disposable plates, garbage and freezer bags (both for sale in stores and in its restaurants) by 2020. One of the nation's largest grocery chains, Kroger, will stop offering single-use plastic grocery bags by 2025.

Each year, 8 million metric tons of plastic waste end up in the ocean, and it's having a devastating effect on ocean-dwelling species, according to a Starbucks press release.

When Starbucks first announced the big news in 2019, it was well-received by many people.

But some pointed out that the company still runs through a lot of plastic with its cold-beverage cups and lids.

On the Starbucks straw ban... I get that eliminating plastic straws is a start, but when single-use plastic straws only account for about 4% of plastic waste and you're still using plastic cups, it's more of a way to try and make yourself ~look good~ innit — Rhianna (@rhiannaoliviab) July 9, 2018

It's about time Starbucks saved the world by not serving plastic straws with their plastic cups and plastic lids — John Pittsburgh (@HereComesTrebil) July 9, 2018

But it isn't just about the straw for Starbucks when it comes to focusing on reducing plastic waste. The company is also working to develop a recyclable and compostable hot cup in partnership with Closed Loop Partners through its NextGen Cup Consortium and Challenge.

Until the chain's more eco-friendly straw and lid changes become permanent, there's another simple way to help cut down on waste — and it will save you money if you go to Starbucks a lot. Simply bring in a resuable cup for a sweet discount: it's usually 10 cents off any sized drink, but sometimes the stores will offer additional promotions, like a free refill.

On Monday, Starbucks announced that it will stop using plastic straws in its 28,000 stores by 2020. Instead, the company will use a strawless lid on most of its cold beverages, replacing the more than 1 billion green straws the company hands out each year.

John Sidanta, the CEO and founder of PRIMASTRAW, a company that manufactures straws for major chains like Starbucks, told Yahoo Finance in a LinkedIn message that it’s the “right decision” for the coffee giant to want to “change, reduce or replace” the materials currently being used in its straws.

He emphasized, however, that Starbucks would never be able to eliminate straws entirely because of some of the drinks offered. Furthermore, he noted that children and people with certain disabilities would continue to need straws.

Like any company leader confronted by changing customer demands, Sidanta recognizes this is just part of doing business.

“[W]e have provided solutions since 10-15 years ago,” he said. “For straw manufacturers, we have to cope” by providing alternative materials while delivering the same function. He did, however, say alternatives won’t work if costs are significantly higher.

The strawless revolution

Lately, it seems that there’s been a movement to go strawless. In March, “Entourage” actor Adrian Grenier spoke at Starbucks’s annual meeting encouraging shareholders to pass a resolution for the coffee company to get rid of plastic straws.

“I’m here not because I was asked to be, I’m here because I have seen this destruction firsthand. I’m here because I care, and Starbucks, I want you to care more,” Grenier said at the meeting. “I am business friendly and I understand the challenges associated with innovation on a global scale, but solutions are already on the market and our competitors have begun to take action.”

While the resolution Grenier presented on behalf of As You Sow failed to pass — as shareholder resolutions often do — Starbucks paid attention to the star’s plea.

Back in 2016, Emily Alexander and her team in research and development spent weeks working on a strawless lid for customers to enjoy the creamy foam of Starbucks’s Nitro beverage. It turns out that lid design will play an important role as the company moves to reduce waste by going strawless.

Grenier, a UN Goodwill Ambassador, applauded the company’s announcement.

“Starbucks taught the world how to drink coffee, and I believe that this commitment will help teach the world how to embrace sustainable business practices—starting with the plastic straw,” Grenier said.

Starbucks is not alone

The world’s largest seller of coffee joins other major corporations on the strawless bandwagon.

Also on Monday, Hyatt Hotels (H) said it would end single-use straws and drink picks and start offering eco-friendly alternatives. Hilton Hotels (HLT) plans to remove the 5 million plastic straws it hands out each year by the end of 2018. Passengers on board Royal Caribbean (RCL) will only receive a straw with a drink order if they request it.

Last year, a 16-year-old Girl Scout Shelby O’Neill successfully convinced Alaska Airlines (ALK) to ditch 22 million single-use stir straws and citrus picks the airline uses each year for marine-friendly alternatives.

In May, Bon Appétit Management Company said it would ban plastic straws and stirrers companywide in its 1,000 cafés and restaurants in 33 states with the phase-out expected to be completed by September 2019.

The movement extends beyond big businesses. Goldenvoice’s Coachella Music and Arts Festival eliminated an estimated 300,000 single-use plastic straws.

This spring, the University of Portland became the first university to ban plastic straws on its campus. Other schools including Knox College in Illinois and California State University, Chico went strawless.

Meanwhile, cities across the U.S. have banned single-use plastic straws and utensils.

Dozens of cities have already established bans or restrictions on the use of plastic straws in restaurants, and legislators in at least two states, California and Hawaii, have introduced proposals that would restrict their use.

The city-level bans have grown in prominence in recent years, as cities including Miami Beach, Malibu and Seattle have taken steps to ban their use. More large cities are following suit, with proposals in progress in New York City, San Francisco and Portland.

California Assemblyman Ian Calderon has proposed a bill that would make it a crime for sit-down restaurants to offer customers plastic straws.

In New York, City Council Member Rafael Espinal has introduced the bill, which as currently written, would be an outright ban on single-use plastic straws or beverage stirrers at any food or drink establishment. Espinal sees it as a reasonable step that local communities can take to promote sustainable decision making by their populations.

""It's no secret that plastic is becoming a bigger and bigger problem across the globe. Cities should be looking at ways to reduce the use of single-use plastics,"" Espinal said. ""I think it's a very easy step that individuals can take to reduce the amount of plastic they're using every day. It'll also increase the awareness of the broader problem.""

The citywide initiatives trace back to a broader focus on the environmental harm of plastics, according to David Wooley, executive director of the Center for Environmental Policy at the University of California-Berkeley Goldman School of Public Policy.

""I think it's part of a bigger trend,"" Wooley said. ""The other thing that's driving this is that plastics in large part come from fossil fuels. Some of the increase in the use of fossil fuels, especially natural gas, is around the creation of plastics. There are public interest groups that focus pretty heavily on the plastics issue.""

But these public policy efforts have had an adverse impact on people with disabilities, who have defended plastic straws as an essential, cost-effective and effectively necessary tool to help them sustain their livelihoods.

Such bans have unintended consequences, Robyn Powell, a disabilities activist and lawyer told ABC's Brad Mielke for the ""Start Here"" podcast.

""I think that the unintended consequences are people are not going to be able to drink independently which clearly you need to drink in order to live,"" Powell said. ""And I think that again it just is a matter of engaging with the disability community to try to come up with an equitable solution that can really ensure that people with disabilities can independently drink while also ensuring that we are working towards saving the environment.""

Daniel Gilbert is a Kentucky-based disability advocate living with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The disorder makes it difficult for him to use his arms and hold drinks, so straws are essential to his ability to drink.

“Plastic straws are the ones that work best for me,” Gilbert says. “They are the easiest for me to use and they provide the most independence for me. They’re easier to position. A lot of other straws aren’t flexible and can’t bend.”

The European Union is proposing bans on plastic products like cotton buds, straws, stirs and balloon sticks when alternatives are easily available in an attempt to cut marine litter, May 23, 2018. Barbara Woike/AP

Stories like those of Gilbert, Powell and other people with disabilities have particular resonance in light of the effort to reduce the use of plastic straws, which has become a prominent public campaign in recent years.

Plastic straws make up just a small percentage of the over eight million metric tons of plastic trash that the University of California Santa Barbara’s National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis estimates enters our oceans each year.

But the environmental impact can be visceral at times, as a graphic 2015 viral video of a crew of marine biologists removing a straw from a turtle’s nose showed.

Companies such as McDonald’s, Marriott and Bacardi have already committed to reducing the use of straws as a step toward sustainability.

Governments have also been taking up the initiative. Seattle passed a ban on plastic straws earlier this month, and other major U.S. cities including Portland, San Francisco and New York City have taken steps to curb their use, while proposals have been introduced to ban them in both California and Hawaii.

The UK has also introduced proposals to ban the commercial use of straws nationwide, with even Queen Elizabeth II changing the royal policy to phase out plastic straws and bottles from royal estates.

Advocates for banning plastic straws have pointed to alternatives, including paper straws and sturdier reusable straws made of steel or glass. But opponents raise the issue that many alternatives are less cost-effective than plastic straws, something that hurts people with disabilities.

A study from the University of New Hampshire’s Institute on Disability found that more than one-in-five working-age people with disabilities live in poverty, substantially higher than the national average.In addition, the alternatives can have downsides that can hurt disabled people trying to use them.

Gilbert points out that some of the alternatives to plastic straws are difficult or even impossible to use.

“A lot of the other ones, like paper, they dissolve in hot drinks. So I can’t drink hot drinks with a paper straw,” Gilbert said. “I’ve tried the metal straws but they’re not the right length… they’re harder to drink out of because they require more lung force for the liquids.”

Gilbert highlighted that disabled critics of the plastic straw ban also want to take steps to help the environment but that plastic straws are one of the most important tools they use to function easily in society.

“It is also important to point out that disabled people do care about the environment as much as we can,” Gilbert said. “You want to protect the environment but you also want to help people and you don’t want to take away something that will help someone participate in society. You may be harming people without realizing it."

The Starbucks Company will eliminate single-use plastic straws from its more than 28,000 company operated and licensed stores by 2020.

Plastic straws will be replaced with new recyclable strawless lid and alternative-material straw options, the coffee chain announced on Monday, July 9.

Starbucks is the largest food and beverage retailer to make such a global commitment. The company anticipates the move will eliminate over one billion plastic straws per year from Starbucks stores, according to the announcement.

Strawless lid (Photos/Starbucks) Starbucks

Cold drinks now account for 50 percent of all Starbucks beverage sales in the United States, up from 37 percent just five years ago.

Starbucks has designed, developed and manufactured a strawless lid, which will become the standard for all iced coffee, tea and espresso beverages.

The lid is currently available in more than 8,000 stores in the U.S. and Canada for select beverages, such as Starbucks Draft Nitro and Cold Foam.

In addition, Starbucks will begin offering straws made from alternative materials, such as paper or compostable material. They will be available by request for customers who prefer or need a straw.

“For our partners and customers, this is a significant milestone to achieve our global aspiration of sustainable coffee, served to our customers in more sustainable ways,” Kevin Johnson, president and chief executive officer for Starbucks, said.

The announcement comes a week after its hometown of Seattle banned plastic drinking straws and utensils. The company already offers alternative straws in Seattle.

Customers in Seattle and Vancouver will be the first to see the strawless lids implemented, starting this fall, with phased rollouts within the U.S. and Canada. A global rollout of the strawless lid will follow, beginning in Europe.

“Starbucks' goal to eliminate plastic straws by 2020 from their stores globally represents the company’s forward thinking in tackling the material waste challenge in totality,” said Erin Simon, director of sustainability research & development and material science at World Wildlife Fund (WWF), U.S.

Plastic straws that end up in our oceans have a devastating effect on species. WWF hopes others will follow in Starbucks' footsteps, Simon said.

Starbucks' decision is a shining example of the important role that companies can play in reducing plastic in the ocean, Nicholas Mallos, director of Ocean Conservancy’s Trash Free Seas program, said in the announcement.

“With 8 million metric tons of plastic entering the ocean every year, we cannot afford to let industry sit on the sidelines, and we are grateful for Starbucks' leadership in this space,” Mallos said.

The movement to eliminate plastic straws has been gaining tremendous momentum around the globe, as consumers show increased concern for the greater issue of plastic waste.

Other companies have also showed participation in the movement away from plastic straws.

McDonald’s voted down a proposal requesting a report on plastic straws in May.

However, the burger chain said in June that it will switch to paper straws at all its locations in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It will also test an alternative to plastic ones in some of its U.S. restaurants later this year.

MGM Resorts International announced their new program, ""That's The Last Straw,"" in a statement on Monday, July 9.

The program aims to reduce single-use plastic straws at their company-operated restaurants in the U.S. The initiative will eventually remove more than 250,000 straws a day from landfills and waterways, according to the tweet.

New York City Council Member Rafael Espinal introduced a bill on Wednesday, May 23, that would ban the use of plastic straws and stirrers in New York City bars, restaurants and coffee shops, as an effort to reduce the growing problem of plastic pollution.

Other cities, like Fort Myers Beach in Florida, have banned plastic straws. Similar proposals are being considered in places like San Francisco.

The anti-plastic straw movement gained traction after a viral video in 2015 showed rescuers removing a plastic straw from a sea turtle's nose.

Americans are estimated to use more than 500 million single-use plastic straws per day in the U.S. alone, an average rate of 1.6 straws per person per day, according to the National Park Service. That translates into 175 billion straws a year.

Of the 8 million tons of plastic trash that flow every year into the world’s oceans, the plastic drinking straw is not a top contributor to all that tonnage.

The top five biggest sources of single-use plastic are plastic bags, water bottles, to-go containers, to-go cups and straws, according to the advocacy group 5 Gyres.

By 2020, every single one of the company’s 28,000 stores worldwide will phase out plastic straws by replacing their current lids with a strawless version that some have described as “adult sippy cups.” If you’ve ordered a nitro cold brew in recent months, the new lids will look familiar; but if you haven’t yet had the pleasure, the company describes the lids as featuring “a teardrop-shaped opening about the size of a thumbprint—a cleaner, less-ridged version of a hot cup lid.” The lids were initially designed to allow customers to “exult in the frothy foam,” which the Starbucks engineer calls “the hero of Nitro coffee,” and unlike straws, are recyclable. Within the next year and a half, the sippy cup will be standard for all iced drinks except Frappuccinos.

Starbucks estimates that the move will eliminate more than 1 billion straws a year. Plastic straw bans have recently gained traction in cities like Seattle and with companies like Starbucks and McDonalds, which announced that they’ll be phasing them out at restaurants in the U.K. and Ireland. The move is one that is undoubtedly beneficial for the environment—a study from earlier this year estimated that as many as 8.3 billion plastic straws end up polluting the world’s beaches. But while Starbucks’ recent announcement might’ve made environmental advocates jump for joy, it struck fear into the heart of anyone convinced that straws are the only thing standing in between their pearly whites and the notorious staining power of their daily Americano.

According to Harvard-trained dentist and Slate contributor Nisarg A. Patel, that fear isn’t entirely unfounded. “If you had to choose between drinking from a straw and drinking from a sippy cup, it’s more likely that the tooth will be exposed to more acid and sugar [through the latter] than it would through a straw,” he said. “There’s a higher risk for damage.” And that damage isn’t just aesthetic. Acidic foods and drinks with high sugar contents (i.e., almost everything on the Starbucks menu) not only create a favorable environment for tooth-decaying bacteria but can also degrade tooth enamel, which can lead to increased sensitivity and decay.

Patel cited a 1998 study in the British Dental Journal that compared drinking from a cup with drinking through a straw, using video cameras to “see what volume of liquid was hitting the surface of teeth. They found that straws were more effective than drinking from a cup in reducing the amount of surface area that was exposed to those liquids.” Although he stipulated that the study had a small sample size, he still recommends that his patients who are concerned about tooth staining or cavities use a straw when drinking acidic, sugary drinks. For those who are both environmentally and dentally conscious, Patel advised drinking a few glasses of water after your daily cup of coffee to help wash out the sugar and partly neutralize some of acidity. Even better: start carrying mouthwash. But he suggested holding off on brushing your teeth immediately: “It’s a topic of debate, but some dentists say that if you expose your mouth to an acidic environment, it softens the enamel. If you then put hard bristles on it by brushing immediately afterwards that can worsen the problem.”

If you don’t want to take any of those precautions, Starbucks is currently testing out eco-friendly straws made out of either paper or compostable plastic, so you can still enjoy your daily iced soy no-whip, no-foam macchiato with reduced dental damage—for now."

The company announced Monday that by 2020, every single plastic straw will be phased out of use at Starbucks stores around the globe. The effort, which starts this fall in Seattle and Vancouver and spreads from there, is expected to keep 1 billion Starbucks-green straws out of the Earth's garbage dumps and oceans each year.

To replace straws, Starbucks will serve cold drinks in cups with special lids—dubbed ""adult sippy cups"" by the Internet—which it introduced back in 2016. These lids can be recycled, unlike the straws. And for all those Starbucks addicts who still demand a straw to suck down their icy frapps, baristas will have paper and compostable plastic straws on hand. (Compostable plastic straws, however, are not marine biodegradable.)

Getting rid of plastic straws will not save our oceans, environmentalists warn. But it will cut down on plastic pollution that kills marine life, and trash waste in general. Even more importantly, it's one of the easiest uses of plastic for us to give up, and once we do, we might want to rid more plastic from our lives. Call it a ""gateway plastic.""

In other environmentally friendly news, Starbucks' hometown Seattle just kicked off a city-wide ban on plastic straws, making it the first major U.S. city to do so. If this trend spreads (and hopefully, it will), we'll be drinking our iced coffees and diet pop with a little less guilt.

Esquire got in touch with Starbucks Philippines regarding this pro-environment initiative. The local franchise has been using the special strawless lids for their cold foam and nitro beverages. They also take P5 off the drinks price for customers who bring their own cups.

A Starbucks rep told Esquire: ""In the Philippines, we are giving customers the option to skip the plastic straws/disposable utensils for their orders. Compostable straws are available by request for customers who prefer or need a straw. This is one more step in demonstrating how our commitment and scale can make a big impact in communities around the world.""

Why plastic straws then?

The United Nations and individual politicians didn’t specifically target straws.

Much of the movement began with the European Union’s and the United Kingdom’s bid to reduce plastic waste from oceans.

In April, British Prime Minister Theresa May pledged to eradicate plastic waste by 2042 as part of a “national plan of action.”

But their directive highlighted several types of single-use plastics, which included straws, but also cotton buds, wet wipes, stir sticks, and more.

Part of the reason plastic straws became such a hot-button issue is because of a viral video, which showed marine biologists removing a straw from a sea turtle’s nostril.

Rochman said the video accurately shed light on how straws can hurt animals.

“There’s evidence of straws being the culprit, causing death in animals when they eat them or causing injury when they get stuck in organs,” she said.

https://people.com/food/starbucks-eliminating-plastic-straws-environmental-impact/,Why Starbucks And Other Companies Are Ditching Plastic Straws To Help Save the Environment,https://people.com,7/11/18,"Big brands like Starbucks are joining the effort to eliminate plastic straws, and although it may seem like this hot button issue appeared overnight, many have been advocating for the environmental cause for years.

Entourage star Adrian Grenier has been vocal about forgoing plastic straws since 2015, when he co-founded a nonprofit called Lonely Whale that calls for stores to “#StopSucking” with plastic straws. The campaign enlisted many celebrities to fight for a strawless ocean, including Russell Wilson, Amanda Seyfried, Ellen Pompeo and Chelsea Clinton, among others.

Starbucks announced plans to switch to strawless lids at stores worldwide by 2020, citing environmental consciousness and ocean conservancy in their efforts. Other food service companies across America have also reduced their plastic straw count, including McDonald’s who announced plans to ban straws in the U.K. and test alternative materials in select U.S. stores. Seattle even banned straws altogether and the city imposed a $250 fine on any establishment who doesn’t follow the rules.

But how much of an environmental impact could these efforts actually have? “While eliminating single-use plastic straws will by no means remedy the plastic pollution crisis, by our estimates, Starbucks’ commitment alone will keep more than 2.5 billion single-use plastic straws out of their coffee shops, and out of our world’s ocean,” a spokesperson from Lonely Whale tells PEOPLE in a statement. “We hope that industry peers will join Starbucks, as well as McDonald’s prior announcement, with even more bold commitments to save our seas.”

Although there is no clear data on exactly how many plastic straws Americans use each day—500 million is a commonly used statistic, but has since been debunked—straws are among the most common type of plastic waste found in the ocean. According to a study by the World Economic Forum, at the current rate, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish by the year 2050.

Julie Andersen, Global Executive Director for the non-profit organization Plastic Oceans, says there is a common misconception that straws are recyclable, but because of their low structural integrity, they cannot be re-used the same way other plastics can be. Therefore, straws and other single-use plastics, which they classify as “anything you use for an average of ten-minutes” such as water bottles, plastic cups and plastic bags, make up 50 percent of plastic waste, and often end up in the ocean, where they break down into micro-plastic and harm the ecosystem.

“This belief that we can all use plastic and you can throw it away and it’s going to disappear and it’s going to dissolve or degrade—that is a false belief,” Andersen tells PEOPLE.

According to Andersen, once plastic enters the ocean, it can choke sea creatures such as whales, seals and sea turtles who mistake it for food. After it breaks down into micro-plastic, the chemicals leak into the water and act as magnets to other toxins because it is oil based, which disrupts the food chain with unnatural and unhealthy substances. When fish feed on those toxins, it ends up in their fatty tissue, which is the part of the animal that humans consume, she says.

“The fish, the kelp, they maintain their own ecosystem and their balance underneath the sea so that we maintain a healthy ocean,” says Andersen. “If you start disrupting that balance by adding in more plastic that is harming all the creatures and all the life under the sea, the potential damage is extremely high.”

With all the plastic products out there, it may be puzzling why the focus is on straws specifically. “Straws are an easy place to start because it doesn’t impact the product you want,” Andersen says. “So if you go out and you get a drink, in theory you could just drink it out of the cup. The straw itself is just an accessory. Whereas it is tougher for people to get rid of the plastic bags in the grocery stores like produce bags, because unless you bring your own bag, how do you take all of your mushrooms or your little items? All of the sudden it compromises the actual product you want to take.”

Although organizations such as Plastic Oceans and Lonely Whale have been fighting to eliminate single-use plastic for years, adding big brands such as Starbucks and McDonald’s to the strawless movement has given it momentum—but Andersen says it doesn’t end the problem. For example, even though eliminating plastic straws from Starbucks could remove billions of straws per year, she points out that the strawless lids they replaced them with are still considered a single-use plastic, and though they tout them as being more recyclable, that means they have a higher structural integrity and use more plastic to create. While Andersen understands this is a commendable effort, one goal of Plastic Oceans is to ensure these companies enforce recycling internally.

“We recognize positive changes and this is one change but we’re here to continue to push—to not lose that momentum,” Andersen said. “Not say, ‘oh we’ve solved the problem’ and let that rock roll back down the hill. It is commendable but it’s important for people to recognize that this is just one small step.”"

It has the pliability that makes a straw so pleasurable to use and you can chew on it all you want. But using a silicone straw makes you feel like a baby using a sippy cup. With every sip, you regress to toddlerhood, glimmers of your inner child floating to the forefront of your psyche. The downside is that you have to suck way harder than you would with any other type of straw. But that should give some of your muscles a good workout? Maybe?"

In an effort to reduce waste, a handful of big companies have announced plans to ban single-use plastic straws.

Restaurants

Starbucks (SBUX) Starbucks said that it will stop using plastic straws in its 28,000 stores by 2020. Instead, the company will use a strawless lid on most of its cold beverages, replacing the more than 1 billion green straws the company hands out each year. The lids are currently available in around 8,000 stores when customers order the Nitro Cold Brew topped with sweet cream. As part of the effort to move away from plastic straws, Starbucks’ iconic Frappuccino drinks will use a paper straw or one made from a sustainable material, the company said.

In May, Bon Appétit Management Company said it would ban plastic straws and stirrers companywide in its 1,000 cafés and restaurants in 33 states with the phase-out expected to be completed by September 2019.

Furniture giant IKEA said it would remove all single-use plastic from its in-store restaurants by 2020.

Airport food-service company HMSHost will stop using the approximately 100 million straws it hands out each year by 2020.

Pret A Manger and Costa will eliminate their plastic straw usage and switch to a sustainable alternative.

Hotels and Airlines

Also on Monday, Hyatt Hotels (H) said it would end single-use straws and drink picks and start offering eco-friendly alternatives. Hilton (HLT), the parent company that manages 14 hotel brands, plans to remove the estimated 35 million plastic straws it hands out each year by the end of 2018. On July 18, Marriott International (MAR) followed and announced that it will remove plastic straws and drink stirrers from all of its 6,500 hotels and resorts worldwide by 2019.

Royal Caribbean (RCL) will be plastic-straw free on all of its cruise ships by 2019. The cruise line presently has a “straws upon request” policy.

On Tuesday, American Airlines (AAL) said it will remove plastic straws and stir sticks from its lounges and instead serve drinks with biodegradable straws and wooden stir sticks. In November, the airline will begin removing plastic straws and stir sticks from its flights and replace them with eco-friendly alternatives.

Last year, a 16-year-old Girl Scout Shelby O’Neill successfully convinced Alaska Airlines (ALK) to ditch 22 million single-use stir straws and citrus picks the airline uses each year for marine-friendly alternatives.

Entertainment

The movement extends beyond restaurants, travel, and hospitality. In June, SeaWorld (SEAS) announced that it removed single-use plastic straws from all of its 12 parks. Disney (DIS) will remove all of its plastic straws and plastic stirrers by mid-2019. The company estimates it hands out 175 million plastic straws and 13 million stirrers annually. Presently, Disney’s Animal Kingdom Park forbids plastic straws.

The global coffeehouse chain announced on Monday that it will immediately begin phasing out plastic drinking straws from its 28,000 stores worldwide and eliminate their availability almost completely by 2020. Given that the company uses around a billion straws every year, that could make a significant difference to the health of our seas.

We're removing plastic straws in our stores globally by 2020—reducing more than 1 billion plastic straws per year from our stores. — Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) July 9, 2018

Drinking straws are just part of a planet-wide plastic pollution problem. Humans generate around 35 million tons of plastic pollution annually and about a quarter of it -- 9 million tons -- ends up in the ocean, according to a 2015 University of Georgia study published in the journal, Science. Of that, about 2,000 tons (4 percent) is made up of discarded straws. But since these items weigh on average .42 grams (1/67 of an ounce), we're still dealing with billions of individual units. According to Australian scientists Denise Hardesty and Chris Wilcox, some 7.5 million straws litter America's shorelines alone. They estimate that as many as 8.3 billion straws can be found on the world's coastlines.

""For every pound of tuna we're taking out of the ocean, we're putting two pounds of plastic in the ocean,"" Sherry Lippiatt, California regional coordinator for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's marine debris program, told the AP.

Our polluting practices have wrought havoc on the marine ecosystem for years but a call for action went out in 2015 when Christine Figgener, a marine biologist at Texas A&M University, posted the following video of a sea turtle having a straw graphically removed from its nostril to YouTube. It's been viewed more than 30 million times since its posting and helped to coalesce public support for banning plastic straws.

""There are several of these single-use items the public is realizing, hey, we don't actually need these,"" Denise Hardesty, a scientist with Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, told the Chicago Tribune.

Even so, banning straws should only rectify around 4 percent of the plastic pollution problem, right? ""Banning straws is about as important as spitting in the wind,"" Psychologist Robert Gifford told Grist in July. But the action carries with it a ""foot in the door"" benefit, he explained. ""A lot of social psychology research says that if you get people to say yes to a small request, they are more likely to accede to more serious requests."" So by building support for small changes, like banning straws, society should in the future be able to further nurture support for more fundamental environmentally-friendly changes.

Looks like an adult sippy cup but really it's the new @Starbucks straw-free iced coffee lids! They come with the nitro cold brews, but you can ask for one for any cold drink to be more eco-friendly 🌎☕️ pic.twitter.com/OyzEKDucPS — Abby Isaacs WMAR (@AbbyIsaacsNews) July 3, 2018

In the straws' places, Starbucks is developing a recyclable spouted lid that has been described as an ""adult sippy cup."" These lids, according the the company, ""will become the standard for all iced coffee, tea and espresso beverages."" It's already available at 8,000 North American locations for the company's Draft Nitro and Cold Foam drinks. Seattle and Vancouver customers will be the first to see these new lids on all their drinks starting this fall. The rest of the US and Canada will get them by the end of 2019 and the rest of the world will receive them after that.

However, not everybody is entirely enthused with Starbucks' new-found environmental conscience. The disability advocacy group, One in Five, protested earlier this year against MSP Kate Forbes' ""Final Straw"" campaign to ban plastic straws from the UK, arguing that paper, plant-based and metal alternatives are not always suitable.

""Most paper and plant-based alternatives are not flexible or suitable for drinks over 40C, therefore increases the risks of choking,"" the group wrote to the MSP in February. ""Metal straws can be dangerous for people with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's whereas reusable plastic straws present hygiene concerns to people with specific health conditions.""

Here in the US, advocates have fought similar local measures. The city of Berkeley, California in June floated the idea of banning plastic straws. The Center for Independent Living applauded the city's environmental efforts but pointed out in a letter to the City Council, ""due to deficits in manual dexterity and various other factors, a significant number of folks require straws to drink beverages. It is important that Berkeley, as it moves forward with any plan, remember the needs of its disabled residents and to accommodate those needs.""

Concerns from the disabled community aside, the push to reduce plastic usage has gained steam over the past couple of years. Hyatt Hotels Corp also announced on Monday that it would only give plastic straws upon request at restaurants and bars in its 700 properties starting September 1st.

Starbucks' announcement came a week after Seattle, Washington (where the coffee company is headquartered), implemented its city-wide ban on plastic straws in restaurants. Fort Myers, Florida has already enacted a similar ban and like-minded propositions are currently being considered in both San Francisco and New York. In May, the European Council unveiled a plan to ban 10 plastic items that constitute 70 percent of the pollution in European waterways. What's more, the EC's proposal would shoulder plastic producers with the cleanup costs.

At the start of June, McDonald's announced that it would begin phasing out plastic straws from more than a thousand of its restaurants throughout the UK and Ireland. Back in February, Dunkin Donuts announced that it would phase out polystyrene foam cups from its stores by the start of the next decade. And in March, the European Space Agency said that it would begin measuring plastic pollution levels from orbit to provide a more accurate count than current estimates.

Whether these specific steps taken by a few multinational corporations have any noticeable effect on the Earth's oceans remains to be seen. However, Starbucks' actions set a precedent, allowing it to serve as a role model for other environmentally conscious companies. And when we're facing a problem as ubiquitous as plastic pollution, we've got to start somewhere. Even if the first steps don't solve the problem outright.

It was a hot day at the zoo when Jordan Carlson's son, who has motor-planning delays, got thirsty. ""We went to the snack bar and found out they had a 'no straw' policy,"" Carlson says. ""It was a hot day and he couldn't drink.""

Their only option was to leave the park and look for a business that sold drinks with a straw. Without one, her son can't drink beverages. At home they use reusable straws, and she tries to keep some on hand when they leave the house, but ""I'm human and sometimes I forget,"" Carlson explains. People with disabilities have to be much more conscious of what businesses and communities offer, Carlson says.

On social media, many people are ecstatic about the crush of cities and businesses pledging to ban plastic straws once and for all. Ever since a video showing a sea turtle with a straw stuck up its nose went viral, campaigns like #StopSucking for a strawless ocean have gained considerable traction. Seattle this month implemented a citywide ban on plastic straws, Starbucks announced on Monday that it will phase out the use of plastic straws by 2020, and many other municipalities and businesses are likely to follow suit. As one Twitter user posted, ""My waiter asked 'Now, do we want straws OR do we want to save the turtles?' and honestly we all deserve that environmental guilt trip.""

But for many people with disabilities, going without plastic straws isn't a question of how much they care about dolphins or sea turtles; it can be a matter of life or death.

There are many alternatives to plastic straws — paper, biodegradable plastics and even reusable straws made from metal or silicone. But paper straws and similar biodegradable options often fall apart too quickly or are easy for people with limited jaw control to bite through. Silicone straws are often not flexible — one of the most important features for people with mobility challenges. Reusable straws need to be washed, which not all people with disabilities can do easily. And metal straws, which conduct heat and cold in addition to being hard and inflexible, can pose a safety risk.

""Disabled people have to find ways to navigate through the world because they know it was not made for us,"" says Lei Wiley-Mydske, an autism activist who has autism herself. ""If someone says, 'This does not work for me,' it's because they've tried everything else.""

""Also, what if you decide on the spur of the moment to go have a drink with friends after work but forgot your reusable straw that day?"" adds Lawrence Carter-Long, communications director for the national Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund. ""[That] doesn't leave a lot of room for spontaneity — something nondisabled folks get to largely take for granted.""

On social media, many people have responded to claims that people with disabilities need plastic straws by asking what people did before plastic straws were invented. ""They aspirated liquid in their lungs, developed pneumonia and died,"" says Shaun Bickley, co-chair of the Seattle Commission for People with DisAbilities, a volunteer organization that's supposed to advise the city council or agencies on disabilities issues.

How much plastic straw and stirrer pollution is out there? Scientific estimates vary. One report suggests they make up more than 7 percent of the plastics found in the U.S. by piece. By comparison, the same report found plastic bottle caps alone accounted for nearly 17 percent. But straws make up a much smaller percentage of pollution by weight.

Environmentalists have latched on to a figure stating that Americans use over 500 million plastic straws every day — a number that was derived from phone calls made by a 9-year-old boy in 2011. Despite its frequent repetition, there's uncertainty over the accuracy of that figure.

In a post detailing how the plastic straw became the cause du jour for those who love the oceans, Dune Ives, executive director for the Lonely Whale Foundation, wrote, ""We found plastic water bottles too endemic, plastic bags already somewhat politicized, and no viable alternative for the plastic cup in ALL markets."" So they chose plastic straws, a ""playful"" alternative and a "" 'gateway plastic' to the larger and more serious plastic pollution conversation.""

Most of the plastic in the ocean does come from land, says Darby Hoover, senior resource specialist for the Natural Resources Defense Council. She notes that because plastic breaks up into smaller and smaller particles, it can be hard to tell what it used to be in some cases.

""Straws are maybe not the biggest source of either plastic pollution or disposable plastic we consume, but they're in there,"" Hoover says.

And for many people who want to consume less plastic, she says, straws are low-hanging fruit.

Yet in general Hoover says that she is wary of outright bans on things. ""I personally think we as a country use way too many disposable water bottles. That said, there are times when I'm caught somewhere, don't have a reusable bottle, and want the option to have water and not a sugary drink.""

""They key is breaking habits,"" Hoover says. ""Is something a habit because you truly need it or because you got used to doing it that way?""

Carter-Long says he is sympathetic to environmental concerns about plastic pollution, but any public policy aiming to reduce the use of straws needs to make accommodations for people who might need them. Ideally, he says, ""each restaurant owner [would] follow their own conscience, maybe keep a stockpile of plastic straws in their storerooms for people to use who need them.""

A spokesman for Seattle Public Utilities confirmed to NPR that the city's new plastic straw ban does include a waiver allowing restaurants to give disposable, flexible plastic straws to customers who need them for physical or medical reasons. But Carter-Long and Bickley say there doesn't seem to be widespread awareness of the exemption. Bickley says he asked over a dozen Seattle chain restaurants — including McDonald's and Chipotle — ""if they had plastic straws available for people with allergies or need, and they told me no.""

And just because an exemption is written into law doesn't mean businesses will comply, even if they know about it. ""So many businesses try to get around already ignoring things with [the Americans With Disabilities Act] until someone says, 'I need a ramp or wider hallway or ramp in bathroom or Braille menu,' "" says Jordan Carlson. ""Sometimes you need to bring a lawsuit just to have your voice heard.""

Although Bickley serves on a commission that is supposed to advise Seattle's city agencies on disability issues, he says no one consulted the group before passing the plastic straw ban.

Dianne Laurine, who lives in Seattle, has cerebral palsy, is quadriplegic and has no use of her extremities. ""She is old enough to remember a time before plastic and everybody just used rubber straws,"" Laurine's caretaker, Bill Reeves, says on her behalf, since she has a severe speech impediment.

""They ended up being disgusting, hard to clean. The advent of plastic in the 1950s changed her life,"" Reeves says.

When asked what it felt like when the straw ban went into effect without consulting those with disabilities, Laurine audibly repeated one word, ""Awful. Awful. Awful.""

""You're putting this burden on disabled people to come up with a solution. You're not asking companies that manufacture straws to come up with a version that works for us,"" autism activist Wiley-Mydske says. ""You won't even take the bus instead of driving your car somewhere,"" she says, adding, ""How many of you are willing to die for the environment?""

The company will slowly start serving all iced beverages except Frappucinos in recyclable plastic sippy cups—and Frappucinos will come with a paper alternative.

It’s another liberal gesture from the company that brought you nondenominational holiday cups, entreaties to discuss racial divisions, and, back in 1996, a $3 weekly pamphlet of magazine takes hotter than steamed milk. As the company’s trademark green straws go out of production, they will also get out of the garbage. Straws are suddenly at the vanguard of a campaign against single-use plastics like bags, bottles, cups, utensils, and wrappers. Because none of these items can be easily recycled, a shocking number wind up in the sea and then inside the bellies, throats, and organs of sea turtles and other large ocean dwellers.

Straw bans took off after a video of an olive ridley sea turtle with a straw wedged up its nose went viral in 2015. Viewed more than 30 million times, the video launched a movement and inspired a leading paper-straw company, Aardvark, to develop a white paper straw printed with green turtles. Alaska Airlines abandoned straws and plastic stirrers in May (the company used 22 million a year); Seattle became the first major city in the U.S. to ban plastic straws earlier this month.

Anti-straw advocacy is a more middling proposition. Yes, straws are an invention so frivolous they would appeal, among our ancestors, only to a hunter-gatherer trying to sip from an eddy in a stream.

So far, the movement against single-use plastics has focused mainly on plastic bags, a larger and more pernicious plastic foe. Single-use plastic bags have been restricted in a handful of countries, including China, and in several U.S. cities and states. Even Shabab, the Islamist terror group at war with the Somali government, banned plastic bags for environmental reasons last week. But bag bans in the United States have been subject to fierce resistance from plastics manufacturers and the Republican politicians they support as well as, in a more humdrum way, people who order a lot of takeout.

Measures like these, which are always to some degree good for the planet and inconvenient for consumers, fall somewhere around the intersection of two axes: environmental gain (usually in the long term) and consumer cost (usually immediate). Indoor smoking bans, for example, were high in the right quadrant, as they instantly improved the air quality inside bars and restaurants with few repercussions for the general population. (Smoking rates were already plummeting.) The 1990 Clean Air Act fought acid rain at no perceptible cost to the average American.

Anti-straw advocacy is a more middling proposition. Yes, straws are an invention so frivolous they would appeal, among our ancestors, only to a hunter-gatherer trying to sip from an eddy in a stream. Popularized during the early 20th century as part of a “Yankee mania for sanitation,” the disposable straw now primarily serves the comically bourgeois function of letting us sip from iced drinks without getting ice in our mouths. (That’s good for your teeth too, but only because everything we drink is so full of sugar.) Needless to say, the serious public health benefits of straws have long since been obviated by modern advances in public health (though for Americans with disabilities, access to straws remains vital). Meanwhile, according to a global survey of beach cleanups conducted by the Ocean Conservancy, straws and stirrers are the seventh-most-common item of beach trash after cigarette butts, plastic bottles, bottle caps, food wrappers, grocery bags, and plastic lids.

On the flip side: Straws are less likely to distract turtles than, say, bottle lids that resemble surface insects or fractured balloons that look like jellyfish. By weight, straws likely constitute a minuscule fraction of ocean waste, and therefore, make up a tiny fraction of the so-called plastic soup that constitutes the ocean’s biggest hazard. “My big concern in a global context is micro plastic,” said Brendan Godley, a conservation scientist at the University of Exeter. “All these big bits are breaking down into smaller bits and converging on areas where baby turtles live, and if we don’t reduce that, we’re going to have baby turtles all eating plastic messing up their insides.”

Seattle announced the prohibition last fall as part of a business-led campaign, “Strawless in Seattle,” to promote biodegradable alternatives. Led by the Lonely Whale Foundation, a clean-ocean project co-founded by the actor Adrian Grenier, the monthlong effort kept 2.3 million straws out of the garbage. In their place came biodegradable straws, of varying quality, in such a rush that manufacturers are struggling to keep up.

“We see straws as a gateway,” Grenier told me. The foundation, he said, had been pushing Starbucks to commit to straw reduction for about a year and a half. (It also partnered with Alaska Airlines.) “Plastic is so engrained in our lifestyle and our culture that to ask people to make absolute, grandiose change is unrealistic.” In other words, giving up straws may not change the world, but you don’t have to change the world to give up straws.

Critics sense a trap lies in these kinds of proud, visible, but globally inconsequential acts of environmentalism. At Grist, Shannon Osaka writes that a straw ban—like, say, letting your A/C hum along at 74 instead of 68—risks functioning as a “moral license” that allows back-patting liberals to take their strawless iced latte and climb back into their SUVs with a clean conscience.

Not using a straw is apparently something that makes people feel good. And that’s important.

This is, of course, possible. But there’s something encouraging about the way strawlessness seems to be trickling across businesses and customers, from Starbucks and Alaska Airlines to upscale New York restaurants to the Chicago White Sox. At first, the movement appears to resemble the soda taxes that have spread to several U.S. cities in recent years—the confiscation of something we like even if it’s bad for us (our teeth, or our planet). Each tactic smells of nanny statism, a metaphor embellished by the fact that the formerly straw-punctured lids of Starbucks iced lattes are being replaced with a high-design, disposable iteration of a cup for babies.

But they are in other ways opposites: A soda tax is the quintessential egghead health policy—popular and sensible in the minds of the academy, but with no clear constituency of consumers rooting for it. Not using a straw, by contrast, is apparently something that makes people feel good. And that’s important: Taxes, bans, and other environmental initiatives don’t work unless they have broad popular support. In California, a grassroots gas-tax recall is gaining steam because Democrats have failed to tie the surcharge to quality-of-life improvements. In China, a 10-year-old plastic bag ban appears to be floundering. The prohibition on superthin bags has had unforeseen effects: At KFC in Beijing these days, every meal comes in a thick, white, single-use plastic bag—nearly all of which are thrown away immediately.

The most effective change, in other words, starts from below and rises to the top. That way, it’s already socially enforced by the time it’s codified. An example of this is the way environmentally conscious Americans cut up six-pack rings in the 1970s and ’80s. Vermont voted to ban nondegradable six-pack rings in 1976. In 1988, Ronald Reagan signed a bill requiring they be manufactured to degrade in sunlight. (This, by the way, is a story of social awareness leading to regulation, not environmental success: Six-pack rings may not strangle dolphins anymore, but they do degrade into plastic soup.) Six-pack rings, like straws, were once considered a “hidden hero” of modern design; today, as Massachusetts Rep. Gerry Studds put it, they epitomize the plastic-pollution problem, as “a highly successful product that is functional and durable, yet ugly and deadly when improperly discarded.” He might as well have been talking about straws.

Does it make a difference to the future of the planet if you don’t take a straw? Maybe not. But Starbucks removing 1 billion plastic straws a year from circulation? That’s something. Straws going out of fashion would be something more. And once you’re not taking a straw with your cup, maybe you’ll remember to think twice about grabbing that plastic bag too."
https://fortune.com/2018/07/11/ditching-plastic-straws-replacements/,These 8 Companies Are Ditching Plastic Straws. Here’s How They Are Replacing Them,https://fortune.com,7/11/18,"Starbucks announced its plans this week to eliminate all plastic straws from its stores by 2020, which the company described as “forward thinking in tackling the material waste challenge.” The coffee purveyor is joined by at least seven other companies in ditching plastic straws to cut back on environmental waste.

The world’s oceans are filled with more than 150 million tons of plastic, according to the Ocean Conservancy. Starbucks estimates that its plans will eliminate more than 1 billion plastic straws each year from its more than 28,000 stores around the country.

So what will companies replace their plastic straws with? Here’s a brief guide.

1. Starbucks

Starbucks will replace straws with recyclable plastic lids for all cold beverages. Straws made from other materials, like paper and compostable plastic, are also available for use with Frappuccinos upon request.

2. Hyatt

Starting September 1, the hotel company will only make plastic straws available by request. Hyatt added that “eco-friendly alternatives” would be made available for other products, but did not specify what the alternatives are.

3. Hilton

Hoping to cut its environmental footprint in half by 2030, Hilton Hotels outlined its plans to remove plastic straws from 650 properties in 2018. The company says it will replace the plastic straws with a paper or biodegradable option.

4. Marriott UK

In February, Marriott International said it would remove plastic straws from more than 60 of its UK hotels, according to the BBC. The company says it will provide alternative options, like biodegradable or paper straws to customers who request them.

5. American Airlines

American Airlines joined Starbucks and Hyatt by announcing on Tuesday its plans to ditch plastic straws by November of this year. The company will replace plastic straws onboard planes with biodegradable alternatives.

6. Alaska Airlines

Alaska Airlines also announced in May that it would start to replace plastic straws this summer with “sustainable, marine-friendly alternatives,” according to the Associated Press.

7. SeaWorld Entertainment

SeaWorld Entertainment announced as “part of its mission to protect animals and habitats worldwide,” that it would eliminate single-use plastic straws and bags from all 12 of its theme parks. The company did not include in its announcement any plans to replace the products with other sustainable materials.

8. Royal Caribbean

Earlier this year, the company said it would eliminate plastic straws from all 50 ships by 2019. Royal Caribbean also said it will offer paper straws to customers by request.

Plastic Straw Bans

In addition to the companies announcing plans to eliminate plastic straws, a number of cities have also said they would ban them and fine facilities that don’t comply. Cities with plastic straw policies include Miami Beach, Seattle, Oakland, and Berkeley.

While some environmental groups have applauded the efforts to clean up oceans by eliminating plastic straws, disability rights groups have said that a total ban on would negatively affect people with physical disabilities.

Access Living, a Chicago-based disability rights organization told Fortune that banning plastic straws is cause for concern: “Many people with disabilities rely on plastic straws as the only way they can drink. Some have proposed the use of metal, glass, bamboo, or paper straws and all of these have issues for at least some people with disabilities.”

The group explained that straws made from alternative materials such as metal, glass, and bamboo “can cause pain or injury to the mouth. Paper straws have a tendency to dissolve. Many people with disabilities need the flexibility of plastic straws because of how their bodies work, or because of how they use their mouths to sip.”"

CNN —

In an effort to reduce ocean pollution, Starbucks announced on Monday that it plans to eliminate plastic straws from all stores by 2020. While lessening our environmental footprint is important, Starbucks (and other companies making similar decisions) seem to have forgotten one major concern: How a world without plastic straws will impact people with disabilities, many of whom use these types of straws out of necessity.

The Seattle-based coffee giant outlined its plans in a press release that seemed to signal a new era for the company. Soon, plastic straws will be a thing of the past at all 28,000 stores worldwide, replaced with what some are calling “adult sippy cups”: A straw-less lid for all iced coffee, tea and espresso beverages.

Straws made from paper or compostable plastic will be available upon request for customers who prefer or need them. However, there is still concern surrounding the option of paper straws, because they might not be sturdy enough for people with limited muscle control.

There’s no doubt that Starbucks’ intentions are pure, and seeing companies take steps to become more eco-friendly should always be applauded. But as a person with a disability, I can’t help but hold back on the applause – just a little.

These types of unilateral decisions simply don’t take into account the needs of those who will be most impacted. Sure, not everyone will need plastic straws, but people with disabilities should be given the option to use them if they need to.

In an email response, Starbucks told me, “We will work with the disability community to ensure we continue to meet their needs going forward.”

And while that’s at least an acknowledgment of the issue, it doesn’t immediately address the difficulty that disabled people have grasping or holding a cup, or even drinking directly from a cup.

Take me, for example. My hands are deformed as a result of my disability, and this makes it hard for me to pick up some cups. My neck is also fully fused, which makes using straws ideal, because I can’t bend my neck back to sip from a lid.

But I’m not the only one. For Karin Hitselberger, a writer and disability advocate, this access is a requirement. “To the average nondisabled person, a plastic straw seems like a nice-to-have accessory, but for many disabled people, plastic straws are a necessity,” she wrote last month for Rooted In Rights. “Straws are an access issue, because without them I wouldn’t even be able to take a drink of water in most public places.”

The move to eliminate plastic straws is just the latest example of the able-bodied world overlooking the disability community when making policy decisions that will directly affect their lives. And even more than just overlooking us, it seems like people with disabilities are not being included in conversations that strip them of some of their autonomy.

Sadly, though, this trend is nothing new.

We’ve seen it in colleges debating the banning of laptops and other tech devices from the classroom. An outright ban on such devices is harmful to those with disabilities who rely on technology for everything from note-taking to test-taking.

We’ve seen it at concert venues that forget about things like accessible seating, leaving disabled folks unable to see the stage.

And we’ve seen it, most recently, in the various marches (i.e. the Women’s March, the Families Belong Together March, etc.) that have excluded people with disabilities because of accessibility issues, including not being wheelchair accessible. In marches like these, where we’re demanding justice and equality, including those with disabilities should be a given.

In fact, society’s lack of inclusion and accessibility is the very reason Congress passed the Americans With Disabilities Act in the first place. The landmark 1990 legislation aimed to remove barriers and combat discrimination against people with disabilities.

The introduction to the ADA reads: “The ADA is one of America’s most comprehensive pieces of civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination and guarantees that people with disabilities have the same opportunities as everyone else to participate in the mainstream of American life – to enjoy employment opportunities, to purchase goods and services, and to participate in state and local government programs and services.”

The ADA was a win because it eliminated barriers to access by requiring basic accommodations such as ramps and elevators – structures that able-bodied people might take for granted, but that disabled people had to fight long and hard for.

It seems our battle is far from over. Though Starbucks calls its decision an “environmental milestone,” it’s important to remember that this isn’t a milestone for everyone. For many of those with disabilities, this is a significant step back.

I urge Starbucks to seek out the opinions and recommendations from people with disabilities in the future. Only then will decisions like these truly be a milestone for everyone."
https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/11/health/plastic-straw-bans-disabled-trnd/index.html,Plastic straw ban: Here’s why people with disabilities are upset,https://www.cnn.com,7/11/18,"CNN —

Daniel Gilbert uses plastic straws to drink his coffee in the morning. For much of his life, the 25-year-old has carried them with him everywhere. He’s had to, because all plastic straws aren’t the same.

Gilbert needs them to be the right length, and they have to be able to handle hot temperatures. And many restaurants don’t offer what he needs.

The Owensboro, Kentucky, resident was born with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disorder that causes the muscles to progressively deteriorate. As his muscles weakened, it became harder for him to pick up something like a cup, so Gilbert began carrying straws when he reached his twenties.

One night, he left his straws at home while he was at a bar with his friends. Typically, he uses bendable ones to position the straw closer to his mouth. But all the bar had was plastic stirrers.

“I had to manage, but it took a lot of effort,” he said. “It was really exhausting.”

Gilbert and other people with disabilities fear that a growing effort to ban plastic straws will limit their accessibility at restaurants, on airplanes and at other service establishments.

Starbucks announced Monday that by 2020, it will phase out the use of all plastic straws in its cafes. This came a little more than a week after Seattle, the birthplace of the coffee giant, banned plastic straws and utensils from the city’s restaurants, bars and food trucks.

American Airlines said Tuesday that it too will eliminate straws from its in-flight beverage service starting in November, replacing them with stir sticks. The announcement follows a similar move by Alaska Airlines.

The bans are meant to be a proactive step in easing the burden that plastic waste has on our environment. But they also may make life more complicated for people in the disabled community who rely on these tools.

Why plastic is better than alternative materials

Going without straws can mean struggling through the physical motion of putting a drink to a mouth, or leaking liquid into the lungs, or choking.

Emily Ladau, an activist and writer on disability issues, has Larsen syndrome, a disorder that affects the development of bones. Ladau is primarily affected in her lower body, so she does not rely on straws, but opts for them because it can be difficult to maneuver in a wheelchair and drink at the same time.

For people who need straws, materials other than plastic just don’t do the job.

Paper? It dissolves, or you can bite through them. Metal? It can get too hot or too cold, and can even be painful for those with symptoms like jitters. Reusable straws can easily be forgotten at home.

“Other types of straws simply do not offer the combination of strength, flexibility, and safety that plastic straws do,” Disability Rights Washington, a nonprofit with offices in Seattle, said in a letter it coauthored to the city.

Gilbert has tried to do his part to educate others on why plastic is the most efficient material, but he often gets told he’s wrong.

“I’d be more than happy to use more environmentally friendly straws,” he said. “(The disabled community) isn’t trying to be anti-environment. We’re just protecting disabled people.”

Video Ad Feedback Beyond Plastic: Is it time to go strawless? 03:23 - Source: CNN

Starbucks, when asked about steps they would take to accommodate the disabled, said in an email, “Customers are still able to get a straw – made from alternative materials – and we will work with the disability community to ensure we continue to meet their needs going forward.”

It is unclear what those materials will be or if plastic straws would still be available.

The London Plane, a Seattle restaurant, started using compostable plastic straws before the ban, which may be an ideal compromise.

But Kate Melges, the plastics campaigner at environmental group Greenpeace USA, said those straws still pose a threat as they must be incinerated at high temperatures to be broken down, which causes air pollution.

“You can’t just throw them in your garden,” she said.

Why focus on straws?

The National Park Service estimates that Americans use 500 million “drinking straws” a day.

Melges, who monitors ocean pollution, told CNN that plastic straws make up a small percentage of the debris found in the oceans and other bodies of water.

On cleanups, she finds many more food wrappers and plastic bottles than straws. But she believes straws are a simpler problem to overcome.

“They’re a relatively easy item to eliminate,” she said. “They’re not a necessity for every single person … they’re the first entry point into tackling plastic pollution.”

What the Seattle ban means

In the Seattle ordinance, there is a yearlong exception for those with disabilities.

“The new director’s rule provides a waiver for flexible plastic straws, which can be provided to customers who need such a straw due to medical or physical condition,” City of Seattle spokeswoman Ellen Pepin-Cato told CNN.

Proof of a disability will not be necessary, Pepin-Cato said. However, the decision to provide plastic straws if needed is up to businesses.

“Requiring people with disabilities to treat a routine fast food trip as something that requires planning and supplies is an unplanned failure in equity,” wrote Disability Rights Washington in its letter to the city.

Ladau, the disability activist, expressed similar concerns.

“Straw bans are a microcosm of the larger issue,” she said. “Access needs are entirely ignored.”

In other cities with straw bans, such as Miami Beach, Florida, there’s no such exception. Miami Beach is, however, considering implementing a three-month educational program to get feedback from residents and businesses.

“The (Americans with Disabilities Act) was passed 28 years ago,” Gilbert said. “There should be sweeping policies.”"
https://reason.com/2018/07/12/starbucks-straw-ban-will-see-the-company/,"Starbucks Bans Plastic Straws, Winds Up Using More Plastic",https://reason.com,7/12/18,"2018 will forever be remembered as the year that hating plastic straws went mainstream. Once the lonely cause of environmental cranks, now everyone wants to eliminate these suckers from daily life.

In July, Seattle imposed America's first ban on plastic straws. Vancouver, British Columbia, passed a similar ban a few months earlier. There are active attempts to prohibit straws in New York City, Washington, D.C., Portland, Oregon, and San Francisco. A-list celebrities from Calvin Harris to Tom Brady have lectured us on giving up straws. Both National Geographic and The Atlantic have run long profiles on the history and environmental effects of the straw. Vice is now treating their consumption as a dirty, hedonistic excess.

Not to be outdone by busybody legislators, Starbucks, the nation's largest food and drink retailer, announced on Monday that it would be going strawless.

""This is a significant milestone to achieve our global aspiration of sustainable coffee, served to our customers in more sustainable ways,"" said Starbucks Kevin Johnson CEO in a press release announcing the move.

The coffee giant says that by 2020 it hopes to have eliminated all single-use plastic straws at its 28,000 stores worldwide. It will now top all its cold drinks with fancy new strawless lids that the company currently serves with its cold brew nitro coffees. (Frappuccinos will still be served with a compostable or paper straw.)

As is to be expected, Starbucks' decision was greeted with universal adulation.

The World Wildlife Fund and Ocean Conservancy both provided ebullient quotes for Starbucks' press releases. Liberal magazine The New Republic praised the move as an ""environmental milestone."" Slate hailed the Starbucks straw ban as evidence of a victory for a bona fide anti-straw movement, one that would hopefully lead to bans of more things plastic in years to come.

Yet missing from this fanfare was the inconvenient fact that by ditching plastic straws, Starbucks will actually be increasing its plastic use. As it turns out, the new nitro lids that Starbucks is leaning on to replace straws are made up of more plastic than the company's current lid/straw combination.

Right now, Starbucks patrons are topping most of their cold drinks with either 3.23 grams or 3.55 grams of plastic product, depending on whether they pair their lid with a small or large straw. The new nitro lids meanwhile weigh either 3.55 or 4.11 grams, depending again on lid size.

(I got these results by measuring Starbucks' plastic straws and lids on two separate scales, both of which gave me the same results.)

This means customers are at best breaking even under Starbucks' strawless scheme, or they are adding between .32 and .88 grams to their plastic consumption per drink. Given that customers are going to use a mix of the larger and smaller nitro lids, Starbucks' plastic consumption is bound to increase, although it's anybody's guess as to how much.

In response to questions about whether their strawless move will increase the company's plastic consumption, a Starbucks spokesperson told Reason ""the introduction of our strawless lid as the standard for non-blended beverages by 2020 allows us to significantly reduce the number of straws and non-recyclable plastic"" as the new lids are recyclable, while the plastic straws the company currently uses are not.

This is cold comfort given the fact that even most of the stuff that is put in recycling bins still winds up at the dump. The company did not address, nor did it dispute, that its transition to strawless lids would increase its overall plastic consumption.

The weight of plastic—not the raw number of plastic objects used, or whether those objects are recyclable—is what should really concern environmentalists.

Pictures of turtles with straws up their noses are certainly jarring. However most plastic, whatever form it enters the ocean as, will eventually be broken up into much smaller pieces known as micro-plastics. It is these micro-plastics that form those giant ocean garbage patches, pile up on the ocean floor, and leech into the stomachs and flesh of sea creatures.

Reducing the amount of micro-plastics in the ocean thus requires cutting down on the aggregate weight of plastics entering the ocean each year. It cannot be stressed enough that straws, by weight, are a tiny portion of this plastic.

At most, straws account for about 2,000 tons of the 9 million tons of plastic that are estimated to enter the ocean each year, according to the Associated Press—.02 percent of all plastic waste. The pollution problem posed by straws looks even smaller when considering that the United States is responsible for about one percent of plastic waste entering the oceans, with straws being a smaller percentage still.

As countless experts have stressed, truly addressing the problem of marine plastic pollution will require going after the source of this pollution, namely all the uncollected litter from poorer coastal countries that lack developed waste management systems.

Straw banners have proven stubbornly resistant to this logic. Instead, they have chosen to rely on either debunked statistics (such as the claim that Americans use 500 million straws a day, which was the product of a 9-year-old's research) or totally unproven notions (like the theory that straws are a ""gateway plastic"") in order to justify petty prohibitions on innocuous straws. And they have been helped along by an uncritical media. Coverage of Starbucks' strawless move saw The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and National Geographic all cite the 500-million-straws-a-day figure.

By adopting a myopic focus on banning straws, environmentalists, city councils, and conscious capitalists are, at best, having no significant impact on the overall problem of marine plastic waste. At worst, they are pushing expensive prohibitions on consumer choice that are counter-productive—at least in the case of Starbucks' ban—and come with all sorts of unintended consequences.

For instance, straw bans will likely hurt disabled people who lack the motor skills necessary to pull off a flawless cup-to-lip motion. While reusable straws exist, they are hard to clean and not always handy when one needs them. ""What if you decide on the spur of the moment to go have a drink with friends after work but forgot your reusable straw that day? [That] doesn't leave a lot of room for spontaneity—something nondisabled folks get to largely take for granted,"" Lawrence Carter-Long of the national Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund told NPR. Senior citizens and parents with young children will likely be affected for the same reasons.

Why not use more eco-friendly disposable straws? Because they are terrible. Paper straws are known to collapse halfway through a drink. Compostable straws cost six to seven times more than their plastic alternatives, don't keep for long, and fall apart when exposed to high heat.

Straws, although not essential for most people most of the time, are still a wonderful convenience that help people enjoy a drink on the go, preserve their carefully-applied lipstick, or save their teeth from the corrosive effects of some beverage. Just yesterday, we as a nation celebrated 7-Eleven's ""Free Slurpie Day,"" a holiday that can't hope to survive in a strawless world.

Giving up on free slurpies and dignity for disabled people in the pursuit of totally illusionary environmental benefits seems like a poor trade-off, yet that is the trade-off straw prohibitionists are forcing the rest of us to accept."
https://time.com/5336242/plastic-straws-history/,The Backlash Against Plastic Straws Is Spreading. Here’s How They Got So Popular in the First Place,https://time.com,7/12/18,"With their announcements earlier this week that they will stop using plastic straws, Starbucks and American Airlines have joined the rising tide against these ubiquitous, disposable tubes. Like the city of Seattle, companies such as Alaska Airlines, and a growing number of environmental groups, Starbucks cited growing concerns over the rising levels of plastic in the world’s oceans in their decision to implement the change. Although these drinking apparatuses only comprise roughly four percent of the some 8 million tons of plastic that is dumped into the world’s seas every year, environmental groups such as Conservation International see the move as “meaningful action to protect our oceans.”

But, if it’s clear that customers can live without them, that fact raises a question: why do we use disposable plastic straws in the first place? And how did they become so ubiquitous as to represent the whole problem with single-use plastics?

Although historians are unsure of the first civilization to grasp at straws, great apes have shown a proclivity for using tubes to aid in their beverage consumption, so “drinking tubes” in some form or another have probably been used by humans for thousands of years. The oldest confirmed straw usage has been found in an Ancient Sumerian tomb dating from approximately 3,000 B.C. On its walls, royals are depicted drinking beer through long, cylindrical tubes; amongst the offerings to the dead are drinking apparatuses shaped out of the precious blue stone lapis lazuli.

Commoners from ancient times until the middle of the 19th century used more accessible materials for their straws—plant materials with a natural tube shape, such as rye grass, dried reeds or, unsurprisingly, just straw. While useful to consumers to a point, these natural straws tended to break or disintegrate while in use, requiring a drinker to use multiple straws to finish a single beverage, or they imparted an earthy flavor to whatever drink they were placed in.

One Marvin Chester Stone, an owner of a paper cigarette-holder factory in Washington, D.C., at the end of the 19th century, did not approve of this tendency to disintegrate. As the often-cited legend in straw history goes, Stone was so bothered by the grassy residue he encountered when sipping his favorite mint juleps that he decided to invent a more palatable alternative to the natural straw. At some point in the 1880s, he wound some strips of paper around a pencil, glued them together, and coated the whole thing in paraffin wax—and the rest is beverage history.

Although specialized (and more durable) drinking apparatuses had been floating around American cups for at least 30 years prior – one A. Fessenden applied for a patent for a metal “drinking tube” in 1850 while one E. Chaplin had created a rubber “drinking tube for invalids” – Stone’s invention became ubiquitous, as a “cheap, durable, and unobjectionable substitute for the natural straws commonly used for the administration of medicines, beverages, &.c.” In the decade following Stone’s 1888 patent application, his paper-and-wax straw became a standby at the rising number of soda foundations that began to reshape the American dining landscape.

Its disposability, too, was key to the popularity of Stone’s artificial drinking straw. At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, public health campaigners were raging a widely publicized war against “the public drinking cup,” a metal or glass cup left at public drinking fountains for all who were thirsty to use. Those common cups were condemned as a source of much death and disease in American cities, but disposable cups were incredibly expensive at the time. Instead, drinkers were plied with single-use artificial straws that were less likely to spread sickness.

The paper straw underwent very few changes in the decades that followed Mr. Stone’s infamous mint julep, aside from attaining its now famous bendy-ness in the 1930s thanks to an inventor in San Francisco named Joseph Friedman. It wasn’t until the 1950s that straws gained their now infamous plastic sheen. The economic boom that followed the Second World War meant more money in consumer’s pockets and a dizzying array of shiny new goods for them to spend it on. Plastics were growing increasingly cheap to produce at this time and so too were fast-food meals, each of them accompanied by sodas in to-go cups with crosshairs that easily tore apart flimsier paper straws. Overtime, the plastic straw overtook the paper as the standard in eateries across the United States and, eventually, across the globe.

Today, it’s estimated that the United States goes through hundreds of millions of straws each day (although the exact number is difficult to count.) The World Watch Institute claims that these straws could circle the entirety of the Earth two and a half times every 24 hours. And while more natural or reusable alternatives to plastic straws are increasingly popping up on the market place, it’s clear the globe still has a tremendous straw addiction, one that’s leaving its mark on both the health of the planet and the quality of people’s drinking experiences. If great apes use them, it’s unlikely that humans will be able to go long without drinking tubes in some form or another, but perhaps the lesson of the history of the straw is that it’s only a matter of time before the next iteration of this timeless drinking apparatus is born.

https://www.eater.com/2018/7/12/17555880/plastic-straws-environment-pollution-banned-alternatives-ocean-sea-turtle-viral-video,Why the World Is Hating on Plastic Straws Right Now,https://www.eater.com,7/12/18,"If we’re to believe the many, many headlines, this might just be the year that the world kicks its plastic straw habit. In recent months, seemingly every major company, several American cities, and smug Instagrammers (not to mention vegan quarterback Tom Brady) have pledged to ditch their plastic straws, leading to considerable media coverage. The effort first saw huge spikes in interest early this year, around the same time that anti-plastic groups like the Surfrider Foundation announced country-wide campaigns to eliminate straws.

And this movement has legs. Many cities have passed, or are in the process of passing, resolutions and all-out straw bans — particularly in areas near the coasts, where plastic waste tends to be more visible. Earlier this month, Seattle enacted its ban on plastic straws and utensils. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has proposed to ban plastic straws, drink stirrers, and plastic cotton buds by the end of 2018.

Alaska Airlines eliminated plastic stir straws and citrus picks from its flights in May. SeaWorld has also vowed to remove plastic straws and bags from its parks; Royal Caribbean Cruises and Ikea also announced bans. A&W Canada announced plans in June to begin switching to paper straws, following in the footsteps of another major Canadian operator of chains like the Keg and Swiss Chalet. Meanwhile, regional chain Burgerville has thrown its support behind Portland, Oregon’s efforts to reduce single-use plastics, and plans to begin testing straw alternatives. Intelligentsia Coffee also confirmed on July 10 that it will remove straws from its 10 coffee bars in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City beginning July 15.

Now, with Starbucks also declaring this week that it will abandon plastic straws by 2020 in favor of (plastic) sippy cup lids and compostable plastic straws, the rest of the food industry will likely be even more compelled to take up the anti-straw cause.

So how did we get here? What exactly is so damning about the plastic straw that has made it the mustache-twirling villain of the food world? And most importantly, will these changes last? Below, all your burning questions about the anti-straw movement, answered:

Are plastic straws really all that bad?

Well, like anything else that a person uses once and then promptly throws in the garbage, they’re certainly not great — even if they look like an innocent, whimsical twisty straw. Because they’re made of relatively thin material, straws break down into smaller plastic particles known as microplastics more quickly. They’re also not easily recyclable in most facilities. According to EcoCycle, roughly 500 million disposable straws are used by Americans daily. (That figure has been criticized; presumably in response to this accusation, EcoCycle’s website notes in its FAQ, “Some environmental groups we talked to told us they believe this estimate to be low.”) Straws were ranked the seventh most common piece of trash collected in 2017 on global beaches by volunteer cleanup crews associated with the Ocean Conservancy, a marine environmental advocacy group.

So why did we start using them in the first place?

Straws have been around for at least the last 5,000 years, according to the Atlantic. Early depictions and examples of metal straws were found in an ancient Sumerian tomb, and South Americans were using metal straws to sip mate long before Europeans established colonies on the continent. In the U.S., people used rye grass straws to drink cocktail through the 1880s, until a man named Marvin Chester Stone came along and patented the design for a paper straw in 1888. The paper variety quickly grew in popularity and even improved in the 1930s with help from Joseph B. Friedman, who developed the bendy straw — which proved useful not only for kids who were too short to drink their shakes at the soda counters, but also handy for hospital patients and people with limited mobility.

Disposable plastic straws eventually grew in popularity with the development of polypropylene plastic in the 1950s, and the straw’s growing presence was helped by marketing that emphasized the straw’s cleanliness, healthfulness, and durability. The plastic industry lobby, which opposes plastic bans and regulations, likes to stress sanitation as an important element: Steve Russell, the vice president of plastics for the American Chemical Society, told Phys.org earlier this year, “in many cases these plastics provide sanitary conditions for food, beverages, and personal care.”

Haven’t we known plastic straws were bad for a while?

So glad you asked. Yes! The Great Pacific garbage patch, for example, was discovered more than 20 years ago by yachtsman Charles Moore, who reportedly sailed through the massive, swirling collection of floating plastic waste. Although plastic straws have been referred to as “the world’s most wasteful commodity,” the vast majority of the plastic waste in the patch is comprised of fishing gear. Plastic has become so common in oceans that it’s being found in large quantities in the bellies of sea birds, whales, and even fish sold at supermarkets.

But “let’s collectively stop eating seafood and fishing with plastic gear” is a far less catchy slogan than “ditch the straw” or “#StopSucking.” The straw movement received a major bump in public consciousness back in 2015 thanks to a graphic viral video shot by a marine biologist who extracted a virtually unrecognizable plastic straw crammed up the nostril of a live and (very uncomfortable) sea turtle. It’s garnered more than 30.7 million views on YouTube alone. And in recent months, organizations like Be Straw Free, the Last Plastic Straw, Strawfree.org, and Strawwars.org have redoubled their efforts.

What does the dude from Entourage have to do with all of this?

Adrian Grenier, better known as that one guy with the thick eyebrows from Drive Me Crazy, has become an outspoken advocate for the straw ban movement (among other marine and environmental causes) through the Lonely Whale, an organization he co-founded in 2015. The Lonely Whale is behind the #StopSucking social media campaign and campaigned for Strawless in Seattle, which lead the city to institute a straw ban in June.

Here’s a photo of Grenier doing his best to recreate the Nirvana Nevermind album cover while calling on Starbucks shareholders to eliminate straws. In March, he even made an appearance at a Starbucks shareholders meeting to present a resolution to create better, more easily recyclable cups — something Starbucks has struggled to achieve.

Isn’t it great that Starbucks is phasing out straws?

Companies rarely do something drastic like eliminate straws unless they’re forced to, or it somehow benefits them. Starbucks likes to be the “good guy” in big coffee, so from a PR standpoint — in a tough year for Starbucks PR — this was probably viewed as an easy win.

But first, prove that these lids are somehow better or easier to recycle than the straws, and then we’ll talk. The lids are still made of plastic, and again, the coffee giant has had a hard enough time addressing its cup-waste issue. Compostable straws, likewise, are only beneficial in an appropriate composting facility; large swaths of the world don’t have access to municipal composting facilities. In other words: Paper straws will decompose only if they ever make it beyond a landfill. Symbolically, though, it’s a move that will likely spur other companies to do the same.

What cities are banning the straw?

After 10 years of plastic reduction efforts, Seattle became one of the first major cities to implement a ban on plastic straws and utensils. Under the new ordinance, businesses may only give out compostable utensils and straws or face a $250 penalty. Oakland approved a new ordinance in May 2018 to ban plastic straws, while cities like Miami Beach have enacted partial bans directed at businesses near beaches. A New York City council member has also proposed a ban on plastic straws. States including California have proposed bills limiting the distribution of single-use straws. Hawaii is seemingly a natural fit for a straw ban thanks to its tourism industry’s reliance on stunning beaches, but the state’s proposed straw ban was killed after vehement objections from the restaurant community. Around the world, Taiwan and Scotland are also in the process of implementing bans on pesky plastic products.

Do bans work?

They certainly can’t hurt. Straw bans and their more lenient cousin, straw-upon-request laws, force industries and consumers to rethink their consumption. Many of the large companies announcing new straw policies did so after cities or countries where they had stores decided to implement tighter regulations on single-use plastics.

But it’s important to note that most cities don’t have the infrastructure for composting biodegradable utensils, and not all products marketed as compostable actually biodegrade. And bans present challenges for small-business owners who are forced to invest in more costly alternatives, or cut back more drastically: In response to Seattle’s ban, Greek restaurant Grecian Corner stopped handing out single-use utensils altogether. Elsewhere, a Seattle bubble tea vendor reported having trouble finding straws that could handle slurping tapioca pearls.

Are there any disadvantages to eliminating straws?

For many people, plastic straws are a issue of convenience, but for some people with disabilities, they’re a matter of safety and independence. Advocates for people with disabilities say that plastic single-use straws — particularly those with a bend — are essential tools that allow people with limited mobility to drink. Alternatives like compostable and paper straws aren’t resilient enough for many people with disabilities to use. Inflexible metal straws, even those with a bend, are also not ideal for people because they can transfer heat from hot and cold beverages, posing a potential safety risk. Hard reusable silicone and metal straws also pose dangers for people with difficulties controlling their bite.

When businesses remove plastic and flexible plastic straws as an option, they’re limiting the experiences of these consumers. According to NPR, Seattle’s ban does include a waver for businesses that provide flexible, plastic straws for people that need them; however, very few people are aware of the exemption.

What’s driving restaurants and bars to ditch straws?

While movement to eliminate plastic bags from stores largely focused on banning campaigns, straw activists took a different tactic: appealing directly to the food and beverage industry. This has given the sweeping changes over the past 18 months the feeling of a grassroots movement.

Kate Icopini, the general manager at Portland, Oregon’s St. Jack, says the restaurant’s bar manager Charlie Dorst proposed a plastic straw ban in January after learning about Seattle’s impending ban on plastic straws and utensils.

After making the switch to greener straw options, St. Jack also joined forces with the Portland chapter of the Surfrider Foundation to help promote the movement. “What we decided to do was get really loud about it and call on our peers in the industry to join us,” Icopini says. “I think a lot of restaurants ... do the right thing both for the world and for their business. But like most things, you are stronger together.” Speaking directly to industry and hosting events, including dinner series and bar crawls focused on raising money for the Surfrider Foundation, has been influential in encouraging other businesses to nix straws.

What are people using instead of plastic straws?

With non-biodegradable plastic straws being phased out, compostable plastic straws, old-fashioned paper straws, reusable metal straws, and even pasta straws (who really wants a soggy noodle in their cocktail?) have come to the forefront. Each option presents its own challenges. Compostable straws are the most natural choice; unfortunately, they’re more expensive than the traditional polypropylene alternative and only break down as advertised if they successfully land in a composting facility — not a backyard pile or a landfill.

At Frita Batidos, a Cuban-style burger restaurant in Ann Arbor, Michigan, chef and owner Eve Aronoff says she originally offered paper straws when the restaurant opened in 2010, but “discontinued them because they would get soggy when placed into liquid.” Now, the restaurant offers a choice of compostable plastic or paper straws. Aronoff says wheat and pasta straws are “more durable, but both have a subtle but distinctive flavor we aren’t looking for.” The pasta alternative also posed a challenge for customers with Celiac disease and gluten intolerance. Frita Batidos is currently looking into options like long-handled spoons for its thick Cuban milkshakes and getting rid of straws altogether.

For businesses that serve primarily dine-in customers, metal straws can be a good alternative. Icopini says St. Jack now offers reusable straws upon request, with the exception of a few cocktails that have a metal straw as part of the format. “We immediately purchased about $60 worth of metal straws from Amazon, and since we’ve done that, we’ve saved money,” she says. Six months into the year, Icopini estimates the restaurant has saved roughly $800 by not purchasing plastic straws. St. Jack has since purchased some metal straws with a bend to accommodate people with disabilities.

Altogether, Icopini says the transition was relatively simple; she’s now trying to devise a plan for what to do with all the remaining plastics straws in restaurant’s stock rooms. “Honestly, it’s that easy,” she says. “All you have to do is just not put plastic straws in your drink, and then confidently stand behind that decision.”

• Starbucks Sippy Cups Will Replace Plastic Straws by 2020 [E]"
https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jul/12/plastic-straw-bans-wont-save-oceans-alarm-disabled/,"Plastic straw bans won’t save oceans, alarm disabled people",https://www.washingtontimes.com,7/12/18,"The rush to clean up the oceans by deep-sixing plastic straws is swelling as big corporate fish like Starbucks jump aboard, even as skepticism builds over whether the campaign is more trouble than it’s worth.

The coffee giant announced Tuesday that it will eliminate by 2020 its signature single-use green straws, the kind found in Frappuccinos and other cold drinks, joining a growing list that includes Hilton, Hyatt, American Airlines, SeaWorld and IKEA, as well as Seattle.

The rising tide has alarmed disabled people, many of whom cannot drink from standard cups, while recent research has shown that when it comes to ocean waste, plastic straws and utensils discarded by U.S. consumers represent a drop in the bucket.

“It’s a symbolic effort that isn’t going to help anything,” said Angela Logomasini, senior fellow at the free-market Competitive Enterprise Institute. “We’re trading a lot for nothing in return.”

She pointed to a 2017 study by German researchers in the journal Environmental Science & Technology that found 10 rivers in Asia and Africa are responsible for 88 to 95 percent of the plastic debris found in the world’s oceans.

“The concern is about plastics in the ocean, which is a real concern, but banning plastic straws isn’t going to fix it because they’re not the source of the problem,” Ms. Logomasini said. “The problem is a disposal problem. Most of it is in Asia and Africa because they have open dumps and they pour tons of trash into the ocean. They don’t have the proper disposal methods. If you dispose of something properly, it’s not a problem.”

A study published in March by Ocean Cleanup found that 52 percent of the debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was fishing nets, ropes and lines, while “microplastics” accounted for 8 percent of the total mass.

Companies have said they will phase in paper straws or bamboo coffee-stirrers, but Ms. Logomasini pointed out that plastic products are more environmentally friendly than those made of paper in at least one respect: Producing plastic takes less energy.

“Making paper is more energy intensive. So are we getting ahead? Probably not. I mean, it’s stupid,” she said. “Why would Starbucks ban straws in Omaha, Nebraska? They’re not getting in the ocean in Omaha, Nebraska. It’s ridiculous.”

Even environmentalists cheering the plastic-straw bans have acknowledged that they won’t have much impact on ocean pollution, but defend the campaign as a way of raising awareness about the issue.

“Banning plastic straws won’t save the oceans. But we should do it anyway,” said Vox in a Monday article.

Dune Ives, executive director of Lonely Whale, which launched last year the Strawless in Seattle campaign, said “the straw becomes this gateway conversation that makes you realize how pervasive and ubiquitous the problem is.”

“Our straw campaign is not really about straws,” Mr. Ives told Vox. “It’s about pointing out how prevalent single-use plastics are in our lives. Putting up a mirror to hold us accountable. We’ve all been asleep at the wheel.”

Leveraging bans on plastic straws to draw attention to ocean garbage has real-world consequences for the disabled, however, many of whom cannot lift cups to their mouths or substitute paper or bamboo straws.

Lawrence Carter-Long, spokesman for the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund, faulted Seattle for failing to consult with or take into account disabled people when moving ahead with its ban on plastic utensils and straws, which went into effect July 2.

“Everyone would like to see viable options to plastic straws, but the practical reality is they don’t yet exist. So we need to take that into account,” said Mr. Carter-Long. “We need to make those accommodations.”

Seattle officials have said that restaurants may provide plastic straws to disabled customers on request, but Mr. Carter-Long said establishments have yet to make the exemption known.

“You’ve got to make that information available both to the public and restaurant owners,” he said. “What we’re hearing in Seattle is the restaurant owners are being told one thing — there’s an outright ban, no one can use plastic straws — and disabled people when they’re calling and asking about this are being told there’s an exemption, but nobody’s seen the exemption.”

Others argue that plastic straws are more sanitary, citing concerns about salmonella rising from cloth shopping bags, which have become more popular in the face of bans on plastic bags.

Even so, the momentum keeps building. New York City and San Francisco are both considering similar measures, and Mr. Carter-Long said there’s scuttlebutt that a plastic-straw ban will be introduced in Congress.

Certainly the anti-plastic camp has compelling PR. A 2015 video showing a sea turtle with a plastic straw stuck in its nose drew worldwide attention, while the #StopSucking campaign on social media has drawn support from celebrities, including New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.

“No more single-use plastic straws. The effect of these little guys [is] posing a huge health risk to our planet,” said Mr. Brady in a video posted last month on Instagram.

Starbucks, which uses an estimated 1 billion straws per year at its 28,000 company-owned stores, plans to phase in recyclable straws and redesigned lids that resemble “sippy” cups.

Nicholas Mallos, director of the Ocean Conservancy’s Trash Free Seas program, urged companies to follow Starbucks’ example, citing the “important role that companies can play in stemming the tide of ocean plastic.”

“With eight million metric tons of plastic entering the ocean every year, we cannot afford to let industry sit on the sidelines, and we are grateful for Starbucks leadership in this space,” said Mr. Mallos in a statement.

Companies determined to make a real difference may want to spend less time focused on straws and more time on the wastewater situation in developing countries, said Julie Gunlock, senior fellow at the Independent Women’s Institute.

“Instead of American companies gesturing their concern by banning straws in American coffee houses,” said Ms. Gunlock in a Federalist op-ed, “they might focus their energy and money (money Starbucks is currently using to transition each store’s straw and lid stocks), to real solutions — like helping to better develop and modernize waste water treatment in Asia and Africa.”

https://time.com/5335955/plastic-straws-disabled/,‘Disabled People Are Not Part of the Conversation.’ Advocates Speak Out Against Plastic Straw Bans,https://time.com,7/12/18,"Some disabled rights advocates are speaking out against an emerging trend of restaurants and other companies phasing out the use of plastic straws with drink orders, arguing that the alternatives can be inadequate for customers with various disabilities.

Plastic straws have been disappearing from coffee shops, airlines, hotels and more amid concerns that they frequently wind up as ocean waste, presenting an environmental hazard. The campaign against them accelerated this week amid news that major companies like Starbucks, American Airlines and Hyatt are drastically reducing their use, in some cases opting for straw-less plastic tops on some drinks instead.

But disability advocates say they feel the campaign against plastic straws is being waged without adequate input from disabled customers.

“The disability community is concerned with the ban because it was implemented without the input of their daily life experience,” says Katherine Carroll, policy analyst at the Rochester, New York-based Center for Disability Rights. “Plastic straws are an accessible way for people with certain disabilities to consume food and drinks, and it seems the blanket bans are not taking into account that they need straws and also that plastic straw replacements are not accessible to people.”

Popular alternatives for plastic straws include options made from biodegradable paper and metal, the latter of which are typically reusable once cleaned. But Jamie Szymkowiak, founder of the Scotland-based “One in Five” disabled rights campaign, says those options may not suit people with certain disabilities.

For instance, Szymkowiak — who says he has arthrogryposis, a condition that affects the movement of his joints — says some disabled people can take a longer time to drink, leading paper straws to get soggy or even disintegrate, potentially increasing the risk of choking. He added that metal straws are usually inflexible, making them more difficult to use for people who have a mobility-related impairment.

Szymkowiak says the disabled community understands and respects the environmental concerns that plastic straws present, but he feels that major companies should work to accommodate and value disabled customers. He and Carroll both want companies to keep plastic straws available behind the counter, and to use their clout to push manufacturers to create environmentally-friendly flexible straws.

Starbucks told TIME that the company “intends to focus on inclusive design to ensure that all customers will be able to enjoy their Starbucks beverages.” An American Airlines representative said the carrier plans to keep a small number of plastic straws and sticks on hand for passengers who may need them. Hyatt did not immediately return TIME’s request for comment, but in a press release said that “straws and picks will be available on request only.”

“It’s just commonplace that disabled people are not part of the conversation when it comes to implementing laws and legislation,” says Szymkowiak. “Having our voices not heard is all too familiar. We recognize the environmental concern and we see the impact single-use plastic has on the environment. It’s good that they are reacting to customer concerns, but a company as big as Starbucks should pay attention to disabled customers’ needs and produce assessable straws.”"
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5951503/Simple-experiment-claims-Starbucks-strawless-scheme-require-use-plastic.html,Simple experiment claims that 'Starbucks' strawless scheme' will require the use of MORE plastic,https://www.dailymail.co.uk,7/13/18,"A simple experiment claims to reveal that Starbucks planned switch to strawless lids in an effort to environmental threat to oceans will actually require the use of more plastic than its previous use of straws with traditional lids, based on weighing the different possible combinations.

The experiment was conducted by Christian Britschgi, assistant editor of Reason, an editorially independent publication of the Reason Foundation, which is a national, non-profit research and educational organization.

'Customers are at best breaking even under Starbucks' strawless scheme, or they are adding between .32 and .88 grams to their plastic consumption per drink,' Britschgi argued in the article.

Starbucks, however, told DailyMail.com: 'The strawless lid is made from polypropylene, a commonly-accepted recyclable plastic that can be captured in recycling infrastructure, unlike straws which are too small and lightweight to be captured in modern recycling equipment.'

In response, Britschgi told DailyMail.com that 'the new lids [being] recyclable has little bearing on how many will end up in the world's oceans and waterways.'

A simple experiment claims to reveal that Starbucks planned switch to strawless lids will actually require the use of more plastic than its previous use of straws with traditional lids; Its strawless lid for cold beverages, which is already in use in more than 8,000 stores, is seen here

The experiment was conducted by Christian Britschgi (pictured), assistant editor of Reason, an editorially independent publication of the Reason Foundation, which is a national, non-profit research and educational organization

Britschgi added: 'Starbucks does not deny that the new lids will result in the company using more plastic.'

In an article touting strawless lid designer Emily Alexander, published on Starbucks' website on Monday, Chris Milne, director of packaging sourcing for the coffee company, explained how this change in form is beneficial to the environment, further.

'We feel this decision is more sustainable and more socially responsible,' he said.

Assuming that the straws used by Starbucks were made of exactly the same composition and type of plastic as its strawless lids, which are already being used for a small number of drinks including Draft Nitro and Cold Foam in more than 8,000 stores in the US and Canada, Britschgi's experiment seems like it's on to something.

He wrote: 'Right now, Starbucks patrons are topping most of their cold drinks with either 3.23 grams or 3.55 grams of plastic product, depending on whether they pair their lid with a small or large straw.'

He explained that he arrived at these results by measuring Starbucks' plastic straws and lids on two separate scales, both of which gave him the same results.

'The new nitro lids meanwhile weigh either 3.55 or 4.11 grams, depending again on lid size,' he said.

'Given that customers are going to use a mix of the larger and smaller Nitro lids, Starbucks' plastic consumption is bound to increase, although it's anybody's guess as to how much.'

'The new nitro lids weigh either 3.55 or 4.11 grams, depending again on lid size,' Britschgi said

'Right now, Starbucks patrons are topping most of their cold drinks with either 3.23 grams or 3.55 grams of plastic product, depending on whether they pair their lid with a small or large straw,' Britschgi said, adding that by his measure, 'Customers are at best breaking even under Starbucks' strawless scheme, or they are adding between .32 and .88 grams to their plastic consumption per drink;' A strawless lid is seen (left) alongside a traditional lid and straw (right)

Starbucks confirmed to DailyMail.com that its straws are also made from polypropylene, like most plastic straws typically are, but that regardless of their composition, most recyclers won't accept them.

'Plastic straws are pretty small and lightweight, so when they’re going through the mechanical sorter, they’re often lost or diverted,' Sam Athey, a plastics pollution researcher and member of the Plastic Ocean Project, a North Carolina-based nonprofit organization that aims to reduce plastic use, told the New York Times.

Britschgi told DailyMail.com that, in his opinion, such a distinction is beside the point.

Starbucks' cited the environmental threat to oceans posed by the single-use products as its motivating factor to accomplish its total ban of single-use plastic straws in less than two years.

'That the new lids are recyclable has little bearing on how many will end up in the world's oceans and waterways,' Britschgi told DailyMail.com.

'Most marine plastic waste is the result of littering or poor waste management. So long as the plastic is properly collected, it's irrelevant whether it winds up at a landfill or a recycling center.'

But from a wider perspective, experts disagree that straws in landfills are no different than straws in oceans and waterways.

Erin Simon, director of sustainability research & development and material science at World Wildlife Fund US, called Starbucks’ decision to eliminate plastic straws 'forward-thinking in tackling the material waste challenge.'

Milne added:

'Starbucks is finally drawing a line in the sand and creating a mold for other large brands to follow. We are raising the water line for what’s acceptable and inspiring our peers to follow suit.'

Aside from noting the results of his experiment, Britschgi also said, 'Straw bans will likely hurt disabled people who lack the motor skills necessary to pull off a flawless cup-to-lip motion.'

As evidence for this, he added that, 'While reusable straws exist, they are hard to clean and not always handy when one needs them.'

But Starbucks also said on Monday it would provide straws made of paper or compostable plastic, not only for use with its Frappuccinos, but also 'for customers who prefer or need a straw.'

'Last year in Santa Cruz, California, Starbucks started testing out straws made from materials other than traditional plastic last year in Santa Cruz, California, and is now testing paper straws in its UK stores, the company said.

To the point of using paper straws, Britschgi wrote in his article, 'They are terrible.'

He added: 'Paper straws are known to collapse halfway through a drink. Compostable straws cost six to seven times more than their plastic alternatives, don't keep for long, and fall apart when exposed to high heat.'

The decision by the coffee company, however, has been widely applauded by environmentalists.

Starbucks announced its decision to ban single-use plastic straws from all of its company-operated and licensed stores, worldwide, on Monday.

The strawless lid is now being piloted for Nitro beverages in China, Japan, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, and will become the company's standard for all iced coffee, tea and espresso beverages.

The switch is expected to eliminate the use of more than 1 billion plastic straws each year, according to estimates by Starbucks Coffee Co, and be fully implemented in its more than 28,000 stores by 2020.

The company's announcement comes one week after it's flagship city, Seattle, banned single-use plastic straws and utensils at businesses that sell food or drinks within its limits.

“We learned [on July 9] about Starbucks’ plan to go strawless and we are excited to hear they are moving this direction,” said Sharon Van Bruggen, director of UCSD University Centers. “From what we understand, it will be a phased process while Starbucks builds up inventory of their exclusive Strawless Lids…[W]e immediately reached out to our regional manager to request early participation.”

For UCSD University Centers, the elimination of plastic straws and other environmentally-harmful products is not a new idea.

“University Centers has been discussing straws and exploring reusable options to offer students,” Van Bruggen said. “Last March, we gave away reusable cups and straws at various student events, and we are researching alternatives such as metal straws to distribute in Fall Quarter.”

University Centers has a wide range of sustainability efforts, from energy and office practices to food, water, and recycling. Notable initiatives include establishing the Sustainability Resource Center in Price Center, requiring future vendors to avoid the use of plastic foam, and encouraging current vendors to use fair trade products. Some vendors, including Jamba Juice, Yogurt World, and Rubio’s Fresh Mexican Grill, have also long been selling compostable or recyclable containers. Other vendors, such as Starbucks, Subway, and Santorini Greek Island Grill, have already phased out the selling of plastic bottles.

UCSD has joined the University of California’s mission to become a zero-waste campus system by 2020 by “increasing sustainable, local, fair trade, and organic food purchased and served by campus food services providers,” according to University Centers’ website.

After Starbucks announced on July 9 it would phase out plastic straws from its stores by 2020, disability rights activists were concerned the policy would exclude some people with disabilities. Several New York City-based groups, including the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled and Disabled in Action, had planned to protest outside a Union Square Starbucks on Sunday after the annual Disability Pride Parade.

“We have something that works. We have something that keeps people alive, and until we have an alternative, this is what we need to use.” — Joseph Rappaport, Executive Director at the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled

The activists had hoped the protest would help spread awareness about their concerns, but cancelled it after a phone call with Starbucks Global Director for Environment Rebecca Zimmer, who reached out to the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled to discuss the policy.

“It was clearly a response to our plans to protest,” said Joseph Rappaport, Executive Director at the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled (BCID).

Starbucks released a statement on Friday specifying that straws would be available for anyone who asks to use them. “Starbucks offers, and will continue to offer, straws to customers who need or request them in our stores,” the statement said.

Leaders from the BCID say they want Starbucks to make sure single-use plastic straws are available, no questions asked, to those who asks for them. On Saturday’s call, Zimmer said Starbucks would provide straws to anyone who asked, but didn’t confirm they would be plastic, according to Rappaport.

“To be clear, they haven’t met our demands, but we’re hoping they will after continuing the conversation,” Rappaport said.

Zimmer was not available for comment on Sunday. “We are pleased with the outcome and look forward to ongoing conversations on this topic,” Sanja Gould, a Starbucks spokesperson, told the NewsHour Weekend via email.

Starbucks’ announcement that they would phase all plastic straws out from their stores has gained praise from many environmentalists. But people with disabilities who rely on plastic straws to eat, drink and live their daily lives say banning straws would harm many in their community and that they were not included in the conversation.

“If you think about it, a straw, it seems so small and insignificant. But this seemingly insignificant thing just shows how little those policy makers and business owners pay attention to us, or want to get our feedback,” said Sharon Shapiro-Lacks, a BCID board member and executive director of Yad HaChazakah, a Jewish organization that advocates for people with disabilities.

“Eliminating plastic straws can cause many people with disabilities like myself not to be able to eat or drink in a restaurant, in a cafe … it’s more than just a convenience. It is a necessity for people like us,” she said.

READ NEXT: Growing advocacy and awareness bringing accessible design to more people than ever

Starbucks isn’t the only company taking steps to eliminate plastic straws. Plastic straw bans have become increasingly popular online, with celebrities throwing their weight behind the issue and social media users using the hashtags #stopsucking and #plasticfreeocean to show their support. Companies like McDonalds, American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Ikea and Hyatt are working on phasing plastic straws out, too.

Seattle became the first major city to ban straws earlier this month, and others like New York City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., are considering legislation to do the same. Scotland, Taiwan, Australia and Costa Rica have passed plastic straw legislation, too. Seattle’s law enables companies to keep plastic straws for people who require them.

A painful viral video from 2015, which shows a marine biologist removing a plastic straw wedged in a sea turtle’s nose, inspired an outpouring of support for plastic straw bans, according to environmentalists working to ban straws. That, plus growing public concern about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and microplastics in oceans and seafood, had made banning straws seem like an easy win to many environmentalists and politicians, according to Rafael Espinal, who authored a bill that would ban plastic straws in New York City.

Starbucks has said they’re committed to finding plastic straw alternatives that work for everyone. But disability rights advocates say those may not exist yet. Plastic straws are flexible, durable, and can withstand hot temperatures in case the user needs it to drink hot coffee or soup, for example. As of now, advocates agree no straw alternatives seem to be able to do the same.

“Other types of straws simply do not offer the combination of strength, flexibility, and safety that plastic straws do,” said several groups, including Disability Rights Washington and the Seattle Commission for People with Disabilities, in an open letter to the Seattle City Council.

Paper straws get soggy and disintegrate, a potential choking hazard. Biodegradable straws can’t handle hot temperatures. Stainless steel straws aren’t flexible, and can be potentially dangerous, cutting the mouth and gums if used improperly. If you’re someone who has seizures, or poor motor function, or have difficulty controlling muscle groups, steel and glass straws may not be a safe option. And Starbucks’ new “adult sippy cups” may not work for people who can’t raise a cup to their mouth.

“People want to solve this problem in a nanosecond, and it’s not that simple,” said Rappaport. “We have something that works. We have something that keeps people alive, and until we have an alternative, this is what we need to use.”

Shapiro-Lacks, who has cerebral palsy, recently testified at a New York City Council hearing about not being able to access a straw on an outing with her husband.

“My husband has had to hold the cup to my mouth in order for me to drink in a manner that draws public attention,” she said. “This compromises my privacy and dignity.”

Starbucks is important because it sets an example for other companies who plan to ban straws, Shapiro-Lacks said.

“If we do reach a good solution with Starbucks, that will be major. And they’re if they’re off track, it sets a very poor example,“ she said.

Editor’s note: This post has been updated to reflect that an open letter to the Seattle City Council was co-authored by several groups."
https://mashable.com/article/plastic-straw-ban-people-with-disabilities,4 things we learned about plastic straw bans from people with disabilities,https://mashable.com,7/16/18,"There is a debate taking place online in reaction to the plastic straw bans spreading across the U.S., Canada, and Europe.

As various cities and companies ban plastic straws, advocates for people with disabilities have taken to social media to voice their opposition. First Vancouver in May, then Seattle earlier this month, and now Starbucks, McDonalds, and American Airlines have created laws or policies limiting plastic straws.

Just this weekend, advocates canceled a protest planned in front of a New York City Starbucks after speaking with a company official about its ban. Starbucks announced on Friday that straws would be available for customers who ask, but did not confirm they would be plastic -- a sticking point for advocates who feel like Starbucks isn't compromising enough.

While many see the ban as a positive way to reduce plastic waste, prohibiting plastic straws may have serious consequences for people with disabilities.

Here are four issues people with disabilities have spotlighted while talking about the ban online.

1. Plastic straws are a necessity for some

Though plastic straws are a luxury for some, they are a necessity for others. Straws function as an accessibility tool and have historically been used to offer independence for people with disabilities. For this reason, some disability rights advocates have asked for a compromise, which requires businesses to provide plastic straws to those who request them, similar to Starbucks' plan. But that trade-off has some worried that people with disabilities, an already burdened group, will face hardship by being forced to ask.

2. Alternatives have their own problems

Disability rights advocates have been voicing concerns over the limitations of plastic straw alternatives on social media as well. Plastic straws are uniquely designed to avoid burning, choking, or otherwise injuring a person. Plastic alternatives like metal and glass can't be flexed like a bendy straw and paper, especially, can be a choking hazard. Biodegradable alternatives can also be more expensive and harm those with food allergies.

3. Feeling shame

Moreover, people in this community already feel they have been shamed for voicing important concerns about their health. Asking them if they've heard about plastic alternatives can be compared to mansplaining.

4. Being excluded

In many ways, the straw ban has shed light on the extent to which people with disabilities are excluded from conversations about the very policies that impact them. People with disabilities have said they are also concerned about the environment, but forcing them to choose between environmentalism and their health is inconsiderate. They've also noted that this isn't the only way to reduce plastic waste and encourage lawmakers and business owners to adopt alternative environmentally-friendly policies.

Overarching lesson: We need to be better about listening to people with lived experiences different from our own and including them in policy changes that affect their lives."
https://nypost.com/2018/07/16/disability-rights-groups-question-starbucks-straw-ban/,Disability rights groups question Starbucks’ straw ban,https://nypost.com,7/16/18,"Starbucks’ recent news to get rid of plastic straws at all its stores by 2020 has raised concerns among disability rights groups.

After the coffee chain made the announcement last week, activists said the elimination of straws could negatively affect some people with disabilities and planned to protest the decision.

“Eliminating plastic straws can cause many people with disabilities like myself not to be able to eat or drink in a restaurant, in a cafe…it’s more than just a convenience. It is a necessity for people like us,” Sharon Shapiro-Lacks, a board member at the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled (BCID), told PBS News Hour.

Several groups in New York City, including BCID and Disabled in Action, were prepared to gather outside a Starbucks in Union Square on Sunday after the annual Disability Pride Parade. But after speaking with Starbucks Global Director for Environment Rebecca Zimmer, the protest was canceled.

Starbucks released a statement Friday saying stores will continue to offer straws for those who request them.

“Starbucks recent announcement about straws will not impact the ability of those who need straws to access them. We take an inclusive design approach to all packaging to ensure that all customers will be able to enjoy their Starbucks beverages,” the statement read.

But while Starbucks has acknowledged the activists’ concerns, Joseph Rappaport, executive director at BCID, told PBS they aren’t yet satisfied. “To be clear, they haven’t met our demands, but we’re hoping they will after continuing the conversation,” he said.

After this weekend’s phone call with Starbucks, Zimmer said it remained unclear whether the straws offered will be plastic, an important factor to those who need straws.

In an open letter posted to Facebook by the group Disability Rights Washington after Seattle’s decision to ban restaurants from giving out plastic straws and utensils unless requested, the organization touted the importance of plastic.

“Other types of straws simply do not offer the combination of strength, flexibility and safety that plastic straws do. Metal straws become hot or cold and offer a risk of injury. Some people…will bite through paper straws and they dissolve if the person takes too long to drink and so forth,” the post read."
https://www.teenvogue.com/story/starbucks-getting-rid-of-straws-is-bad-for-disabled-people,Starbucks’ Elimination of Plastic Straws Is Bad for Disabled People,https://www.teenvogue.com,7/17/18,"In this op-ed, Madison Lawson explains why, though Starbucks' recent announcement about phasing out straws could be a win for the environment, it will negatively impact the lives of many disabled people.

I don’t know about you, but I am not the same person before I have had my morning caffeine. The closest coffee shop for me is Starbucks and I go there probably about seven times a week. But that may soon change after Starbucks announced last week that it plans to eliminate plastic straws from its stores by 2020, in an effort to eliminate material waste.

This sounds like a good thing, making the world a little eco-friendlier, one less straw at a time. To most people, a straw is a small convenience that they can do without. But what I don’t think the company realizes is how much a move like this could change the experience for thousands of customers who, like me, have disabilities that make straws a vital tool for drinking independently.

I have a rare neuromuscular disease that makes my muscles weak and progressively weaker with time. My disease has taken away many abilities over the years. I am unable to do most tasks unassisted including breathing so I have to be on oxygen all day long and I use a power wheelchair to get around. My friends jokingly call me Hazel Grace, to which I reply, “It’s a look.” I always joke that there are five things I can do on my own. Those things include doing my makeup, serving looks, writing, being annoying, and loving with my entire heart and soul. Although five things is a bit of an under exaggeration and there are so many things I can do, I still need help with a lot of tasks. I can’t get in and out of bed on my own, I can’t do my own hair, cut my own food, take a shower on my own, or even go to the bathroom without assistance, a daily ritual me and all my friends call “pee parties.” Although this all sounds like a lot to be upset about, I don’t have time to focus on the things I can’t do. I always say, “Some people can’t walk, but others can’t do a winged liner on their own, who’s really disabled here?”

Having this condition makes it excessively difficult to lift cups to my mouth to take a drink. When I drink things, the weight of the cup can be very difficult for me to manage without getting exhausted. Although yes, I can pick up the drink a few times, it becomes difficult, and my arms are tired and weak the rest of the day when I drink things without straws. Also, the muscles in my neck are affected by the disease and have a hard time keeping my head up when I tip it back to take a drink. With the tipping motion, my weak muscles put me at risk of swallowing liquid down the wrong pipe which is risky for my weak lungs."

That said, there are plenty who've spoken out against the blanket plastic straw ban. Disability rights activists were planning an NYC protest against the new policy for Sunday when they heard from Starbucks, PBS reports.

Related Story Why Everyone's Talking About Plastic Straws Lately

Groups like the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled and Disabled in Action remain concerned that if Starbucks eliminates plastic straws completely, people with disabilities would not be able to or comfortable consuming their beverages.

On Friday, the coffee giant issued the following statement:

Starbucks offers, and will continue to offer, straws to customers who need or request them in our stores. Starbucks recent announcement about straws will not impact the ability of those who need straws to access them. We take an inclusive design approach to all packaging to ensure that all customers will be able to enjoy their Starbucks beverages.

Some were mollified by Starbucks's confirmation, others were concerned the company didn't specifically mention plastic straws, which was what the BCID requested.

A Facebook post from Disability Rights Washington following Seattle's official plastic straw ban explained metal and paper straws ""do not offer the combination of strength, flexibility and safety that plastic straws do. Metal straws become hot or cold and offer a risk of injury. Some people … will bite through paper straws and they dissolve if the person takes too long to drink and so forth.”

https://news.yahoo.com/she-recorded-heartbreaking-turtle-video-185646357.html,She Recorded That Heartbreaking Turtle Video. Here's What She Wants Companies Like Starbucks to Know About Plastic Straws,https://news.yahoo.com,7/17/18,"When marine biologist Christine Figgener filmed her team removing a plastic straw stuck in a sea turtle’s nose in August 2015, she says she had no idea how much it would resonate with the world. She also had no idea nearly three years later, the video would help galvanize a larger movement, which now includes companies like Starbucks and American Airlines, to eliminate plastic straws from our day-to-day lives.

The 34-year-old marine conservation biologist, who is currently finishing her Ph.D at Texas A&M University, says she was “celebrating” last week after several companies followed Starbucks’ lead in announcing plastic straw bans.

“I’m of course happy,” Figgener tells TIME. “But I don’t want the corporations to feel like they’re getting off easily just by eliminating plastic straws. I hope this is the first step.”

The wave of corporate plastic straw bans last week comes after Seattle became the first big U.S. city to ban plastic straws earlier this month — and as public awareness of the negative impact single-use plastic items like straws, cups and cutlery can have on the environment is heightened. (This year’s Earth Day theme centered on plastic pollution.) And Figgener’s video, which currently has nearly 31 million views on YouTube, continues to be part of the conversation as people get more conscious of their plastic usage and want to be more active in protecting the environment. In a way, Figgener has given the anti-plastic movement a face — albeit a reptilian face.

Figgener says she doesn’t want to claim “this video is the one that did it all,” but she did admit it is a good tool for environmental activists and lobbyists to use at presentations that elicits compassion.

Figgener poses with a sea turtle and members of her research team on their boat in Costa Rica in 2015. L to R: Macdonal Gomez, Daniel Stuart, Christine Figgener, Andrey MacCarthy, and Vee Koleff.

“You were able to show the suffering of a creature that was affected by a straw that someone had disposed of. Definitely that was an object that passed through human hands and made its way to the ocean,” she says. “It had a very emotional effect on people and it definitely fueled the movement that already existed.”

Her team discovered the male turtle off the coast of Costa Rica while collecting parasites living on the sea creatures. In the video, one of the researchers uses pliers to slowly pull the object out of the turtle’s nasal cavity, which took about five minutes to completely extract. And the sea turtle appeared to be in physical duress as they removed it — the video shows blood streaming out of his nose and him sneezing and squealing multiple times.

The footage was powerful, and Figgener knew it could be impactful if she shared it on social media. “I thought I can really show what one object can do, what kind of harm it can do,” she says.

Figgener said people still tell her the turtle video changed their habits — whether it made them stop using plastic straws, bring reusable bags to the grocery store or be more cognizant about their plastic use in general. “Everyone can do something at home, even if it’s one thing,” she says.

And Figgener acknowledges plastic is a “miracle product” that changed the world since it became ubiquitous in American culture until the 1950s, when plastic materials became more affordable and the economy was booming. Plastic straws are necessary for some people with disabilities, though using a straw-like apparatus to drink has been around for centuries.

Figgener says straws are just a start; they make up only 4% of the 9 million tons of annual plastic pollution that washes into the world’s oceans and shorelines, according to a 2015 study published in the academic journal Science. But, she says, they’re also a good place to start fighting ocean waste. The drinking utensils are often referred to by environmental activists and groups including the Plastic Pollution Coalition as “gateway plastics” that ease people into single-use items. Plastic straws are also particularly dangerous to animals, and humans, because they break down into small pieces that can be ingested. In fact, one study found that 90% of all seabirds have eaten plastic — a number that has skyrocketed from less than 5% in 1960.

She says she is hopeful that in the near future, the negative impacts of plastic straws will be gone, comparing it to the plastic rings around six packs that have been largely phased out by companies and that people consciously cut up — in part due to similar emotional photos and footage of animals with them stuck around their mouths or heads.

“I hope that in five years time, we don’t even need to discuss plastic straws. That there’s too many alternatives,” Figgener says.

Figgener has a similarly optimistic outlook for the sea turtle featured in the video, who she saw again last year thanks to a tag they put on his flipper for research purposes. While her team was out conducting research in Costa Rica, they found a mating couple. When they got home, she checked the number in her database and confirmed it was the same turtle.

“He seems to be doing just fine and doing his thing,” she says."

NEW YORK — Starbucks will eliminate plastic straws from all of its locations within two years, the coffee chain announced last Monday, becoming the largest food and beverage company to do so as calls for businesses and cities to cut waste grow louder.

While the straws account for a small percentage of the pollution that ends up in the ocean, they've become a flashpoint because they're seen as an easy way to reduce waste.

""There are several of these single-use items the public is realizing, hey, we don't actually need these,"" said Denise Hardesty, a scientist with Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation who studies plastic pollution.

A week after its hometown of Seattle banned plastic drinking straws and utensils, Starbucks said last Monday that by 2020, it will use straws made from biodegradable materials such as paper and specially designed lids. The company already offers alternative straws in Seattle.

Straws often become trash because their small size makes them difficult to recycle.

Other cities, like Fort Myers Beach, have banned plastic straws, and similar proposals are being considered in New York and San Francisco. The push to ban the straws gained traction after a viral video in 2015 showed rescuers removing a straw from a sea turtle's nose in graphic detail.

The issue of waste more broadly is coming up in company boardrooms.

In February, Dunkin' Donuts said it would eliminate polystyrene foam cups from its stores by 2020.

McDonald's said it would switch to paper straws in the United Kingdom and Ireland by next year and test alternatives to plastic straws in some U.S. locations. The burger chain also said this year it would use only recycled or other environmentally friendly materials for its soda cups, Happy Meal boxes and other packaging by 2025.

Plastic drinking straws make up only about 4 percent of plastic trash by number of pieces, and far less by weight. Straws add up to about 2,000 tons of the nearly 9 million tons of plastic waste that ends up in waters around the globe each year.

Still, the advocacy group 5 Gyres notes that the top five biggest sources of single-use plastic are plastic bags, water bottles, to-go containers, to-go cups and straws.

Other plastic items have also been targeted in recent years.

Several local governments have enacted bans and fees on plastic bags. Reusable water bottles have also gained popularity as a way to reduce use of plastic water bottles, with refilling water stations popping up on college campuses and elsewhere.

One reason big chains say it will take time to change practices may be the difficulty in securing adequate supplies. Imperial Dade, a food service and janitorial supplies distributor based in New Jersey, says it's seen a huge spike in demand for alternative straws in recent months.

""Our biggest challenge is trying to locate alternative sources so we can satisfy the demand,"" said Laura Craven, the company's director of marketing.

Craven also said she's starting to see more awareness about the need for exemptions for straws that bend, which people with disabilities and others may need. Starbucks says it expects an alternative it has to work in that regard.

The strawless lids will begin to appear in Seattle and Vancouver Starbucks this fall, with phased rollouts within the U.S. and Canada next year. A global rollout of strawless lids will follow, beginning in Europe, where they will be used in some stores in France and the Netherlands, as well as in the United Kingdom.

American Airlines

American Airlines says it will stop using plastic straws and drink stirs and replace them with biodegradable alternatives.

American said last Tuesday that starting this month in its airport lounges it will serve drinks with straw and wood stir sticks and begin moving to what it called eco-friendly flatware.

American, the world's biggest airline, said that in November on board planes it will replace plastic stir sticks with ones made from bamboo. The airline said the moves will eliminate more than 71,000 pounds of plastic a year.

Alaska Airlines, the fifth-largest U.S. carrier, said in May that it would phase out plastic straws and citrus picks starting this summer and replace them with ""sustainable, marine-friendly alternatives."" Larger U.S. airlines — Delta, United and Southwest — still use plastic straws, according to representatives of those carriers.

Some cities have banned plastic straws because they are often not recycled and wind up as trash in landfills and oceans.

Hotels are making similar moves. Hyatt Hotels Corp. said last week it will eliminate plastic straws and drink stirs from all its properties by Sept. 1. Hyatt said it will provide straws by request only, and will use environmentally friendly alternatives where they're available.

Hilton Hotels also said it will remove straws from the 650 properties it manages by the end of 2018. Hilton estimates that move will eliminate more than 35 million straws each year.

Southwest

Southwest Airlines will stop giving away peanuts on flights next month, ending a tradition that goes back decades.

The airline said last Tuesday it was pulling peanuts from all flights because of concern for passengers with peanut allergies. They will be replaced by pretzels and, on some longer flights, other free snacks.

Southwest says the decision follows months of deliberation and isn't tied to any particular incident involving passengers with allergies.

No snack is more closely identified with a U.S. airline. Over the years, Southwest used the humble legume in marketing campaigns. A blog on its website is called Nuts About Southwest.

Some of Southwest's other early quirks, like dressing flight attendants in hot pants, went out decades ago, but the peanuts survived. Until now."

​As plastic straw bans become the latest trend for companies and governments looking to reduce waste, people with disabilities are speaking out.

Hotel chain Marriott International said Wednesday it would ditch single-use plastic straws, following similar announcements last week by Starbucks and American Airlines. Vancouver passed a law banning plastic straws this year, as did Seattle. California is currently mulling over a state-wide ban.

But people with disabilities say plastic straws are still the best option for folks with limited mobility. Reusable straws aren't always an option given the need to carry and clean them, while plastic alternatives can be a choking hazard for some.

Lawrence Carter-Long, communications director for the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, spoke to As It Happens guest host Laura Lynch about why plastic straw bans fail to take people with disabilities into account.

Here is part of that conversation.

What have these corporations missed when it comes to people with disabilities and plastic straws?

Paper turns to mush. Glass breaks. Metal can get dangerously hot and damage teeth. Bamboo isn't flexible, and neither is silicone. And both silicone and wheat can be dangerous for people who have allergies.

So when it comes to disability and access needs, one size doesn't fit all.

Simply saying something like, ""Use a reusable straw"" isn't going to work for everyone.

Metal straws get too hot to be an adequate replacement for plastic, say people with disabilities and disability rights advocates. (Roger Corriveau/CBC)

Why is the plastic straw the right one for people with disabilities?

Plastic straws in many, many ways — and you can use multiple definitions of the word — are the most flexible.

They are really, I think, across the board, the most useful for the most people.

Important considerations in the push to ban single use plastic straws. Alternatives are not effective, safe for disabled people. Something we should all think about and remember diverse voices and opinions absent from some environmental debates. Thanks <a href=""https://twitter.com/WhySharksMatter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@WhySharksMatter</a> et al. <a href=""https://t.co/lULNjNM2NP"">pic.twitter.com/lULNjNM2NP</a> —@coraloha

Is there a policy from a city council or a large corporation that you feel does take your considerations into account?

I think places like Montreal and others in Canada have an opportunity to learn from the mistakes that have been made in the United States.

The solutions are actually fairly simple. If you don't need a straw, don't use a straw. If you can use a reusable straw, use that. If you need a plastic straw for whatever reason, that should be made available to people.

You shouldn't get the evil eye. You shouldn't get the third degree.

Restaurant owners should have a stock of them in the store room or under the counter for people who ask.

The solutions really are that simple.

How the Great Straw Debate should've gone:<br><br>""Ban straws!""<br><br>Disabled Folx- ""Some of us depend on straws & can't use alternatives. A ban could kill us.""<br><br>Ableds- ""Ah, OK. Ban balloons!""<br><br>Instead we got:<br><br>""You're just selfish! Don't u care about the planet? Fakers! Try harder!"" —@spwarriortweets

Starbucks seems to be doing what you're saying. They're backing off an all-out ban, saying Friday they'll continue to offer straws to those who need or request them. Are they doing what you want?

I think that's a step in the right direction. The problem is that nobody has seen the specifics yet. The devil is in the detail, as the old saying goes.

The ways that these things are implemented are as important as what is implemented, and in order to find solutions that work, you need to involve the disability community from the get-go, rather than afterwards when people start complaining or protesting or causing a ruckus.

Some disability might be obvious — that someone is, let's say, a quadriplegic. But others may not.

This is also an issue for folks who are survivors of strokes, for people who have Parkinson's disease who may have difficulty controlling their bite, for people with cerebral palsy who might produce excess saliva.

So there's a multitude of conditions that these bans affect, and since one size doesn't fit all, we've got to take them all into account in order to be fair.

I'm wondering how you respond to those who say these banning these straws are vital to the health of our oceans?

You can look at studies that say ... about 0.03 per cent of ... the garbage that's accumulated in the oceans are straws, plastic straws.

We're going to get much further much faster by doing things like tagging, tracking abandoned fishing equipment or changing the ways in which we do waste disposal.

That's not to say that we shouldn't put our time effort and energy into the plastics that go into the ocean, including straws, but that we need to have a process in order to take into account those people who need them as those policies are being developed, rather than after the fact.

I'm convinced that the way science is going, one day we'll get there. One day we'll have alternatives to plastic that the majority of people can use.

But until and unless we get to that point, we shouldn't be leaving people out.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/07/18/anti-straw-movement-based-unverified-statistic-500-million-day/750563002/,That anti-straw movement? It's all based on one 9-year-old's suspect statistic,https://www.usatoday.com,7/18/18,"Corrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this article misstated the estimated amount of plastic produced globally since the mid-1950s, which is 8.3 billion metric tons.

The origin of the movement to ban plastic straws may come as a surprise: It began with a 9-year-old boy named Milo Cress and his 2011 campaign, ""Be Straw Free,"" which launched to raise awareness about plastic waste.

His big finding? Americans use more than 500 million drinking straws daily, enough to fill 125 school buses. That figure has become highly touted since, referenced in straw ban coverage from The New York Times and National Geographic to reports from the National Park Service (and USA TODAY).

Now 16 years old, Cress just finished his junior year of high school and finds himself the face of a movement felt by global chains from Starbucks to McDonald's. But it's not without criticism — especially of his 500 million stat.

It started years ago when Cress noticed a trend while out to eat. He would see people take the plastic straws out of their drinks and put them on the table — never actually using them.

This didn't sit right with Cress. It felt like such a waste.

""I thought if restaurants were to offer a straw instead of serving them with every drink automatically, it could really reduce the number of straws that we use,"" he said.

More:People with disabilities concerned about plastic straw ban

He talked to a local restaurant and asked if they would adopt a policy to ""offer first."" They were on board.

Not only was it a cost saver, but it also made customers more aware of plastic they use and eventually throw away, Cress said — especially straws, which have a short-use span but a 200-year lifespan.

Cress talked to restaurants, politicians and peers. His philosophy picked up traction. The idea was digestible, easy enough to understand and practice.

But as Cress began to dig into research on plastics and the environment, he noticed there wasn't much data: ""I couldn’t find anything on our use of straws in the United States,"" he said.

So he called straw manufacturers himself, asking what they estimated to be the straw market in the United States per day. Some gave him a yearly estimate, which he divided by 365.

""Others gave an estimate of around 500 million straws,"" Cress said. ""That was the number that I stuck to, because it seemed to be around the middle of what they were saying.""

But with national coverage of Cress' statistic came criticism: Conservative-leaning outlets such as Fox News, Washington Examiner, and Reason, aimed to debunk the figure.

The teen is aware of objections to the less-than-verified stat.

""Why I use this statistic is because it illustrates that we use too many straws,"" he said. ""I think if it were another number, it still illustrates the fact that there is room for reduction. That’s really my message.""

Eco-Cycle, a Colorado-based recycling nonprofit that partnered with Cress' campaign, trusts his statistic. If anything, said Eco-Cycle communications director Harlin Savage, 500 million straws per day could be too low. And if anyone has come up with a different figure, Savage — plus a lot of other people, she said — would like to see it. She applauded the teen's efforts.

“He saw a problem and it really bothered him, and he decided to do something about it,” Savage said. “He’s a wonderful role model.”

In 2013, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper declared July 11 as ""Straw Free Day"" and cited efforts made by Cress. Cress has also embarked on an international tour encouraging students to act on issues they care about.

So are straws crucial in the war on plastics? It’s a step in the right direction, one expert said.

Kara Lavender Law, research professor of oceanography at the Sea Education Association, said the straw free movement serves as a “public service announcement” for environmental issues.

Law has studied plastics and the marine environment for more than a decade.

“If you look at your own plastics footprint, one of the easiest ways is to decline the straw,” Law said. “Many of us use a straw simply because it came in the drink that was given to us.”

And if one aims to cut down plastic usage beyond the straw, Law recommends cutting “items of convenience, not items of necessity.”

She estimates that since the mid-1950s, 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic have been produced globally. Sixty percent of it now accumulates in a landfill or natural environment, such as the ocean.

These findings were published in a 2017 study Law co-authored called “Production, use, and fate of all plastics ever made."" It’s one of the first comprehensive looks at plastics and where they end up.

And of the 8.3 billion metric tons — a number too high for Law to “realistically count” — her team believes just 9 percent of those plastics have been recycled.

“It’s second only to steel and cement for human production of a mass material,” Law said. “A huge amount has been made, and very little has been recycled or incinerated.”

Businesses and cities ban the straw

https://reason.com/2018/07/18/dont-ban-straws/,Don't Ban Straws,https://reason.com,7/18/18,"Want to sip a refreshing beverage this summer?

If environmental zealots and sycophants get their way, you won't be allowed to sip it through a plastic straw.

Actress Nina Nelson and other celebrities made a video claiming that plastic straws kill sea life: ""In the USA alone, over 500 million straws are being used every single day, most of which are going into our oceans.""

""I will stop sucking,"" vowed the celebrities.

In obedient response, Seattle banned plastic straws, and other places plan to follow. Starbucks, Hyatt, and Hilton are all abandoning straws.

Katy Tang, of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors, says, ""We are no longer going to allow for plastic straws here.""

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio agrees: ""Their time has come and gone.""

But before politicians ban things in the name of saving the world, I wish they'd take the trouble to actually study what good the ban would do.

Plastic garbage in oceans is a genuine problem. But most of the pollution comes from Asia. A small amount does come from America, but only a tiny fraction of that is plastic straws.

Banning straws ""might make some politicians feel good,"" says the Competitive Enterprise Institute's Angela Logomasini in this week's Stossel TV video, ""but it won't actually accomplish anything good.""

But what about that scary ""500 million"" figure that celebrities, politicians and news anchors constantly cite? It turns out that number came from a 10-year-old who, for a school project, telephoned some straw makers.

Because the boy is cute, the media put him on TV. Now the media, environmental activists, and politicians (Is there a difference?) repeat ""500 million straws used daily… many end up in oceans,"" as if it were just fact. The real number is much lower.

Still, activists like talk show host Ethan Bearman tell us, ""If we can reduce something that easy—something that gets stuck in turtles' noses and damages the environment—let's do that. Sometimes, we do need a little gentle guiding hand from government.""

But government's guiding hand is neither ""little"" nor ""gentle."" Government action is force. In this case, the politicians will either ban straws or order us to replace plastic straws with more expensive ones made of paper or bamboo.

Bearman calls that an advantage, telling us, ""Plastic doesn't actually biodegrade, unlike paper, which breaks down into other components.""

But that's exactly the problem. Paper straws don't only break down in dumps, they also break down while you're using them. They get soggy. They leak.

""That's the beauty of plastic. It's enduring,"" says Logomasini.

She also points out that paper and bamboo straws aren't environmentally pristine. ""Paper products take more energy and effort to produce. And paper doesn't degrade in a landfill, either. Everything (in landfills) is essentially mummified.""

Also, paper straws cost eight times more to make than plastic straws.

The activists and politicians don't worry that their ban will raise costs for businesses and their customers. New York City Councilman Barry Grodenchik told us, ""Maybe people won't use straws.""

Ethan Bearman added, ""If it's $1.79 to get the fountain drink at Joe's Corner Deli (and) now it's $1.83, I don't see that being a huge difference.""

""This is what environmentalists say about every policy they put out—a few cents here, a few cents there,"" says Logomasini. ""But eventually, it begins to be a burden. Banning straws isn't going to do anything for the environment. So what they're trying to do is take away my freedom for nothing in return.""

Taking away freedom for nothing in return is now a specialty of the environmental movement.

After our environment got cleaner—thanks to technological innovation and some useful government-imposed requirements (like scrubbers in smokestacks and pollution limits on cars)—the zealots moved on to demand bans on pipeline construction, mining, and oil drilling. They require lots of pointless recycling (though often garbage you separate is never recycled) and all sorts of feel-good policies that make no real difference.

https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/7/19/17587676/straws-plastic-ban-disability,Banning straws might be a win for environmentalists. But it ignores us disabled people.,https://www.vox.com,7/19/18,"There are few things more heartbreaking than hearing from “progressives” that my life, and those of other disabled people, is not worth living — that we should be left to die if we can’t adhere to the latest performative progressive trend.

We are used to hearing this. In the past few weeks, it’s been on hyperdrive as the war on drinking straws has escalated, pushed by environmental groups over protests from members of the disability community.

It started with viral videos of marine life with straws wedged in their nostrils, pushed by groups like Stop Sucking and the Ocean Conservancy, and picked up by sites like Treehugger, BuzzFeed, and the Dodo. The gut public response was that all plastic straws should be banned from the face of the earth, and marine life shouldn’t be suffering for the sake of our frappuccinos.

The movement that ensued was a push to ban (single-use plastic) straws. A growing list of companies like Starbucks and Hyatt are dropping straws, while Seattle, Vancouver, San Francisco, New York City, and many other cities have banned or are thinking about banning plastic straws, as Hawaii and California consider statewide bans.

But the disability community reacted with alarm right away. Disability studies scholar Kim Sauder was one of the first to express concerns about the implications, bringing up an issue that many nondisabled people — and some disabled people — hadn’t considered. Some people need straws to drink because they are unable to lift a cup to their mouths. And there are reasons more environmentally friendly alternatives are not a universal fix, such as allergy concerns with plant plastics, the risk of breaking glass straws with facial tics, or paper that disintegrates under pressure, illustrated in the form of a convenient chart by activist Sarah Packwood.

Renewable straws are not an option for many disabled people

Comparatively speaking, I’m lucky. Although I have hand tremors and facial nerve damage, I can drink fluids unassisted, and I don’t need a straw to do so — most of the time. When I do need a straw, a plastic alternative is fine. But other disabled people must use plastic straws because of the nature of their impairments. They can’t drink out of a standard cup or use a sippy cup.

Reusable straws can be hard to maintain and sterilize, and may not be safe to use, while compostable products, which can dissolve in hot liquids, present a choking and allergen hazard. It’s always going to be a good idea for restaurants and coffee shops to keep plastic straws on hand for disabled people.

Nondisabled people ask what we did before straws existed, and I have harsh news for them: We died. Or we lived in abusive, grim, isolating institutions where we didn’t need straws because we got 24-hour attendant care.

Disability rights advocate Lawrence Carter-Long notes the bendy straw was an “early example of universal design” — inclusive design that benefits disabled people, older adults, and nondisabled people alike, like the curb cuts that help wheelchair users, people with walkers, and parents with young children. Flexible straws were developed to help people drink in hospital settings. As someone who was unable to drink independently in a hospital, I can tell you the appearance of a nurse with a cup of water and a jaunty bendy straw is one of the most heavenly sights imaginable. Even with an IV running full-bore, there is nothing to replace the sensation of a deep, refreshing sip.

That’s what straw ban advocates want to deny us. Bring up straws on social media and you’ll find people so intent on banning plastic straws that they’ll list a litany of alternatives like metal, glass, paper, bamboo, pasta, or compostable plastics that don’t work, or say that anyone who defends straws must be “lazy.”

What we hear when people don’t want to listen to us is that we don’t matter. This kind of rhetoric is familiar. After all, we’ve been hearing we’re drains on the system and wastes of resources for our entire lives. This is just the latest chorus of an old song, and it’s enabled by a growing list of public figures who thoughtlessly parrot rhetoric about how straws should be banned, full stop.

We can save the environment and still be inclusive toward the disabled community

Of course, disabled people share concerns about the environment. Lightweight, ubiquitous single-use products like straws, plastic utensils, plastic bags, and the like are definitely problematic — they’re prone to escaping at recycling centers, tumbling across the landscape to litter the natural environment.

We’d like to see less plastics in the world too. But straws make up a tiny fraction of what’s in the ocean. Images of wildlife impaled on straws and filling their stomachs with plastic are disturbing, but the real problem is microplastics, which result from the breakdown of plastics in industrial waste and bioaccumulate across the marine food chain.

Let me be blunt: Screeching at us about straws is not going to fix the problem of plastic. For that, we need to go higher up the supply chain, rethinking when and how we produce plastics across the board instead of shaming disabled people who are piping up about our needs. And disabled people need to be included in the conversation about reducing plastic waste — our needs matter just as much as trees and sea turtles.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/business/plastic-straws-ban-fact-check-nyt.html,How a 9-Year-Old Boy’s Statistic Shaped a Debate on Straws,https://www.nytimes.com,7/19/18,"Professional estimates of straw usage are hard, but not impossible, to find. Yet, the number this fourth grader came up with in 2011, as part of a personal environmental conservation campaign, has proved surprisingly durable, working its way to the heart of the debate over plastic straws.

“It is honestly a little surprising,” said Mr. Cress, who turned 17 on Thursday. “I came up with this statistic because I couldn’t find anything else about it. If there are other statistics on how many straws we use that are based on more rigorous research than the research that I did, I’m happy to embrace those.”

Fact check: The claim that 500 million straws are used by Americans is an estimate above the ranges of more rigorous studies. Market research firms put the figure between 170 million and 390 million per day, or 63 billion to 142 billion straws per year.

One market research firm, Freedonia Group, determined that the nation used about 390 million straws a day last year. Another, Technomic, puts the number closer to 170 million, though that count excludes some types of straws."
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/23/starbucks-straws-ban-2020-environment,Starbucks is banning straws – but is it really a big win for the environment?,https://www.theguardian.com,7/23/18,"This month, Starbucks joined a growing movement to ban single-use plastic straws, announcing it would eliminate the items from its stores by 2020. In their place, the company will be introducing strawless lids, which have a sippable protrusion. It will also make alternative-material straws available.

Starbucks already has strawless lids available in more than 8,000 of its North American stores. These were developed for its “Nitro” coffee beverages which have a creamy top and are best drunk without a straw. Now, however, the coffee chain will be making the Nitro lids standard for all cold beverages, most of which now come with straws. Cold beverages make up more than 50% of Starbucks’s beverage mix, an increase from 37% just five years ago.

The Seattle-based coffee chain estimates that this move will eliminate more than 1bn plastic straws a year across its more than 28,000 stores around the world. It’s a big win for anti-straw advocates. But is it really a big win for the environment?

Reason, a magazine and blog published by the rightwing Reason Foundation, has claimed that the Nitro lids Starbucks will be making standard use more plastic than a combination of the company’s current lids and plastic straws. Some social media users have also noticed that the Nitro lids are noticeably thicker than the current lids and have speculated about whether they will really be better for the environment. The Guardian weighed the Nitro lids and found that they are indeed heavier than the current lid/straw combination, if only by a tiny amount. Nevertheless, even a tiny bit more plastic adds up quickly, considering Starbucks’s enormous scale.

Starbucks does not dispute that the new lids use more plastic. However, they stress that “the strawless lid is made from polypropylene, a commonly-accepted recyclable plastic that can be captured in recycling infrastructure, unlike straws which are too small and lightweight to be captured in modern recycling equipment.”

While it is true that plastic straws cannot be recycled, it should not be automatically assumed that the new plastic lids will definitely be recycled. Only 9% of the world’s plastic is recycled. A large number of things that are theoretically recyclable do not get recycled for reasons such as contamination.

Compounding this problem is the fact that the US exports about one-third of its recycling, the majority of which goes to China. At the beginning of 2018, however, China implemented a ban on importing plastic waste. Over the last few months states such as Oregon, which have relied heavily on exporting trash to China, have sent much of their recyclables to landfill while they look for another solution.

It is hard to gauge exactly how much Starbucks’s decision to increase its use of plastic, but eliminate plastic straws, will help the environment. To some extent the move to Nitro lids feels like a way to channel some easy PR from the growing anti-straw movement, rather than a meaningful sustainability initiative.

Where Starbucks can make a significant impact, however, is by tackling its disposable cup problem. The coffee chain is described as a “Cup Monster” by some environmental groups, and up to 6bn of its disposable cups end up in landfills every year.

Starbucks recently announced it plans to fix this; the company is working with McDonald’s to develop a global recyclable and/or compostable cup solution, and says it will “continue to push ourselves and work with the industry on solutions to reduce waste”. This isn’t the first time Starbucks has said it is working towards a better cup. A decade ago Starbucks said it would make 100% of its cups reusable or recyclable by 2015. That hasn’t happened yet."
https://theconversation.com/why-you-shouldnt-be-a-straw-man-environmentalist-100303,Why you shouldn’t be a ‘straw-man’ environmentalist,https://theconversation.com,7/24/18,"The “straw bubble” has burst.

We’re midway through 2018, and we have seen an explosion of efforts and local action to eliminate plastic straws. Some of the world’s largest companies, including McDonald’s and Starbucks, have banned them from some of their operations.

McDonald’s announced recently that it would replace plastic straws with paper ones in all restaurants in the U.K. and Ireland by September 2018. Similarly, Starbucks will eliminate plastic straws from all of its stores globally by 2020.

Airlines, hotel chains and local restaurants in droves are all removing the ubiquitous plastic from their consumer services.

Dramatic and evocative statements and statistics, including the infamous “plastic will outweigh fish in the ocean by 2050” prophecy, are inciting some incredible interventions from governments, large multinationals and individual citizens. Although these kinds of statements may not be entirely accurate, the overwhelming response has been the removal of straws from day-to-day society.

Anti-straw backlash

Along with these recent “anti-straw” endeavours, there comes an accompanying “anti-anti-straw” rhetoric that opposes such interventions on various grounds.

For instance, disability rights activists have weighed in on the plastic-straw ban. Some people with disabilities need straws to drink because they have trouble swallowing or cannot lift or hold a cup.

A plethora of alternatives to plastic straws exist to provide practical solutions, including silicone, paper and stainless steel. Ultimately, this means all consumers have an ethical choice to make: planet or plastic?

We don’t contest the importance of accessibility, which is why we do not argue in favour of an absolute outright ban on straws. Rather, we believe that “having a disability and doing your part to help the environment are not mutually exclusive.”

The anti-anti-straw arguments we take issue with are often either libertarian (hands off my straws) or pessimistic (this does not address the root cause of the problem) in nature. Some of these arguments are a mix of both.

Read more: Beyond our oceans: Microplastics pollute rivers and lakes too

A slew of journalists and writers have recently put forward counter-arguments to interventions seeking to reduce ocean plastics. They write that targeting straws specifically will not make a significant difference to the ocean.

Quantitatively, sure, straws make up a small portion of the plastics that enter and contaminate the ocean (roughly four per cent of litter). This does not mean, however, that straws aren’t worth addressing.

Why is a targeted effort towards four per cent of marine litter being attacked as useless or ineffective, when the posited alternative is no effort at all?

Target “gateway plastic”

Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup’s annual Dirty Dozen list highlights the items most commonly found on marine and freshwater shores. Straws rank ninth, below cigarette butts, food packaging, bottle caps and plastic bags.

Other studies have found similar contributions to marine litter from plastic straws. The UNEP 2018 State of Plastics report also ranks straws and stirrers in seventh place for plastics found in the environment.

However, these other plastics require an entirely different approach to mitigating their entry into the environment.

Should we focus on an outright ban on cigarettes with the same vigour as we have straws? Can we vilify single-use plastic bottle beverage industry players in the same manner?

Presumably, those who are anti-anti-straw would respond accordingly, if not an order of magnitude greater, to these kinds of petitions.

War on straws

Dune Ives, the executive director of the Lonely Whale Foundation, has called straws “the gateway plastic” for those on the verge of environmentalism. For example, something as mundane or “playful” as a straw can open up a larger, more serious conversation about plastic pollution, or global mass consumption even more broadly.

This point is both the crux of the “war on straws” and the crucial piece moving forward in the overall endeavour to reduce marine plastic pollution: changing the norm.

Comparisons may also be made with plastic bag bans. For example, many countries and jurisdictions around the world have successfully implemented plastic bag bans or taxes to reduce plastic environmental pollution.

Like plastic straws, some groups suggest that because plastic bags are ultra-lightweight, they likely make negligible contributions to municipal waste. These groups also claim that banning plastic bags is more about appearances and idealism than about protecting the environment. However, like plastic bag bans, the concept of eliminating or replacing single-use plastic (SUP) straws requires a revolution in consumer mentality.

Changing habits

There is no radical extreme call to immediately stop the production of plastic products. Indeed, shaming plastic use has been seen as an ineffective way to get more people on board.

Plastics are imperative in many contexts, including sterile packaging and disposable tools in medicine, reducing food spoilage and increasing food safety. The movement to remove SUP straws, or even bags, should consider these nuances, but it is far from destroying the foundation of modern society.

With about eight million to 12 million metric tonnes of plastic entering our oceans each year, there is an urgent need to address our pervasive plastic problem.

We need a broad-scale and widespread approach that questions our throw-away culture, and the overwhelming trend to buy more, buy bigger and buy more often. Avoiding the use of a plastic straw may seem trivial, but it counts.

It may seem like a drop in the ocean, but what is an ocean anyway but many, many, drops?"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-guilty-greenwashing-plastic-straws-001000069.html,Are These Companies Guilty of Greenwashing Their Plastic Straws?,https://finance.yahoo.com,7/25/18,"Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) is the largest food and beverage company so far to jump onto the latest feel-good environmental bandwagon: banning plastic straws. It will substitute sippy-cup lids and alternative-material straws at its 28,000 company-operated and licensed stores, which it estimates will eliminate more than 1 billion plastic straws per year from its operations.

CEO Kevin Johnson called it ""a significant milestone to achieve our global aspiration of sustainable coffee, served to our customers in more sustainable ways.""

Starbucks new plastic lid

The only problem is that the sippy cup toppers and some of the replacement straws are also made of plastic. While the new lids are recyclable, they actually weigh more than the straws they're replacing. So in effect, Starbucks is using more plastic than it was before.

A lighter shade of green

There's nothing wrong with businesses trying to be more environmentally friendly. In fact, they should be encouraged to do so. But when some companies rush to tout their sustainable actions, more often than not they're really engaging in ""greenwashing"" -- trying to benefit from actions that don't achieve what they claim, or that actually further the environmental harm they say they're trying to minimize.

We saw that with restaurants like McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) and Taco Bell racing to go cage-free with their eggs. While the conditions of factory-raised poultry are a step above those raised in battery cages, the birds are still housed wing to beak, and it remains a sorry life for the chicken. It's hardly the life of a true free-range bird, yet restaurants and food processors got a lot of mileage out of their PR campaigns touting their efforts.

Now we're seeing it with plastic straws. MGM Resorts has a more modest goal than Starbucks: eliminating 100 million straws per year by removing plastic straws from its casinos, restaurants, and bars, and only serving them if asked for by a patron. The move, it says, is ""the latest addition to MGM's comprehensive environmental responsibility program and can further enhance our efforts to protect our planet.""

Third-grade math

The problem is, the figure of 500 million plastic straws used in the U.S. per day being touted to justify the pressure campaigns against food and beverage chains is wrong. In fact, it is based on a three-company survey conducted by a nine-year-old.

In 2011, that child -- Milo Cress -- received a plastic straw in his drink at a Burlington, Vermont restaurant and thought it was an unnecessary waste. In launching a campaign to get local restaurants to stop using plastic straws, he called up three straw manufacturers to get an idea of the size of the straw market and averaged their numbers. Environmental groups and politicians soon latched on to his 500-million-straw figure and began ratcheting up the pressure.

Story continues

Earlier this year, McDonald's shareholders rejected a proposal to study the issue of plastic straws with an eye on banning their use. Nevertheless, McDonald's will ban them in the U.K. and Ireland by the end of next year, and begin phasing them out elsewhere in Europe. But they'll remain at its U.S. restaurants.

Doing nothing by doing something

Although any amount of plastic in the waste stream is too much, and reducing it is a good idea, pressuring businesses to eliminate plastic straws is not going to have any meaningful impact for four primary reasons:

The scope of the problem is exaggerated. More-rigorous analysis by food-industry consultant Technomic puts the number of straws in the U.S. waste stream at a more realistic 170 million to 175 million per day: still a lot, but not quite the apocalyptic numbers being cited by activists.

The alternatives are more expensive, with estimates putting the price of paper straws at around 10 times the cost of their plastic counterparts.

Data from a study published in the journal Science says that of the 20 biggest countries contributing to plastic pollution, the U.S. is last, with less than 1% of the total mismanaged plastic waste. China is by far the world's biggest polluter, contributing as much as 3.5 million metric tons of plastic per year and accounting for over 27% of the total.

Scientific American notes that all the world's rivers dump up to 2.75 million metric tons of plastic into the ocean each year, but just eight of them contribute an astounding 93% of the total -- and all those rivers are in Asia and Africa. The worst is China's Yangtze River, which flows into the Yellow Sea and accounts for an estimated 1.5 million metric tons, or more than half the total.

By all means, eliminate plastic straws from your stores and restaurants, but don't think it will have any meaningful impact on the pollution problem. Corporations claiming they are delivering a significant blow to plastic in the waste stream are merely posturing to allow themselves to look environmentally concerned without having to really resolve the issue. At the same time, they are raising their costs -- and potentially their prices -- and in some cases may even be exacerbating the problem.

Milo, now 17, got the movement started eight years ago at Leunig’s Bistro and Cafe in his hometown.

That's when he asked the cafe owner to institute what he called the 'offer first policy,' rather than automatically giving customers straws, after seeing so many thrown away without even being used.

'He was just a kid,' his mother, Odale Cress, told the Daily Beast. 'He didn’t think he wanted a straw ban. He just wanted people to have the option of having a straw.'

Milo said, simply, 'It seemed like a waste to me.'

Fast forward to today, and Starbucks has just announced it will ban all single-use plastic straws in its 28,000 store across the globe, by 2020.

'This planet is where we live,' Milo said. 'We have an individual and collective responsibility for saving and protecting it.'

The passion behind that statement was there for him, too, nearly a decade ago, even when Milo didn't think Leunig’s Bistro and Cafe would honor his request.

'I was worried adults wouldn’t listen to me because I was kid,' he said. 'But I found the opposite to be true.'

'This planet is where we live,' Milo said, adding, 'We have an individual and collective responsibility for saving and protecting it'

Milo, now 17, got the movement started eight years ago at Leunig’s Bistro and Cafe in his hometown when he noticed that cafe gave people straws that they weren't using

From there, things gained momentum for Milo and his mission to reduce unnecessary consumption.

'Initially, I just was annoyed at the waste,' he said. 'I started talking to some other people, some of my friends, and convinced them to order drinks without straws. It went from talking to people about reducing their waste to more and more people wanting to ban it.'

Once implemented, Starbucks' aggressive plan to remove all single-use plastic straws is expected to eliminate the use of more than 1 billion plastic straws each year, the company said.

Christian Britschgi (pictured), assistant editor of Reason, said straw bans don't make sense

Plastic straw bans have garnered criticism, though, by some such as Christian Britschgi, assistant editor of Reason, an editorially independent publication of the Reason Foundation, which is a national, non-profit research and educational organization.

Britschgi conducted a simple experiment that showed that using lids with sipping holes, as Starbucks plans to do, rather than plastic lids that work with straws may actually use more plastic.

He arrived at this conclusion based on weighing the different possible lid combinations.

'Customers are at best breaking even under Starbucks' strawless scheme, or they are adding between .32 and .88 grams to their plastic consumption per drink,' Britschgi argued in the article.

Starbucks, however, told DailyMail.com: 'The strawless lid is made from polypropylene, a commonly-accepted recyclable plastic that can be captured in recycling infrastructure, unlike straws which are too small and lightweight to be captured in modern recycling equipment.'

Britschgi told DailyMail.com that, in his opinion, such a distinction is beside the point.

Starbucks' cited the environmental threat to oceans posed by the single-use products as its motivating factor to accomplish its total ban of single-use plastic straws in less than two years.

'That the new lids are recyclable has little bearing on how many will end up in the world's oceans and waterways,' Britschgi told DailyMail.com.

'Most marine plastic waste is the result of littering or poor waste management. So long as the plastic is properly collected, it's irrelevant whether it winds up at a landfill or a recycling center.'

Britschgi conducted an experiment that showed using lids with sipping holes, as Starbucks plans to do, rather than plastic lids that work with straws may actually use more plastic

For those who wonder what people who need or simply want to use a straw should do if they become banned in their area, Milo says he sometimes carries a metal straw, but usually just doesn't use one

But from a wider perspective, experts disagree that straws in landfills are no different than straws in oceans and waterways.

Erin Simon, director of sustainability research & development and material science at World Wildlife Fund US, called Starbucks’ decision to eliminate plastic straws 'forward-thinking in tackling the material waste challenge.'

In an article touting strawless lid designer Emily Alexander, published on Starbucks' website on Monday, Chris Milne, director of packaging sourcing for the coffee company, explained how this change in form is beneficial to the environment, further:

'We feel this decision is more sustainable and more socially responsible,' Chris Milne, director of packaging sourcing for Starbucks, said, in an article touting strawless lid designer Emily Alexander published on the company's website on July 9.

The company's announcement of its ban comes one week after it's flagship city, Seattle, banned single-use plastic straws and utensils at businesses that sell food or drinks within its limits.

Starbucks' Seattle and Vancouver locations will be the first to roll out the change.

Some may argue that the most basic alternative to straw use, sipping directly out of a glass, is unhygienic, but Milo and his mom point out that argument doesn't make sense based on how we interact with other publicly used items.

'You don’t drink beer and wine with a straw,' Odale said. 'And you use metal forks and plates at a restaurant. Almost every argument doesn’t hold water (pardon the pun).'

For those who wonder what people who need or simply want to use a straw should do if they become banned in their area, Milo shared what works for him.

'I sometimes carry a metal straw if I’m going to have a milkshake or something,' he said. 'But for the most part, I drink my drinks without a straw of any kind.'

Aside from focusing on reducing waste, the senior at Champlain Valley Union High School has been vocal on the issue of gun control, sharing social media posts in support of tighter regulations.

He's also interested in artificial intelligence, as part of the Vermont legislature AI's task force.

Its goal is to try to figure out how to use AI for the benefit of the people of Vermont.

Arizona Republic

The first time I experienced a straw-less Starbucks drink, I was visiting a friend in Palm Springs, Calif.

We could not have walked into a more sleek, classic coffeehouse location, complete with an array of Starbucks Reserve coffee and warm wood countertops.

It didn't ruin the experience when the barista handed over my drink without the classic green straw, but instead a lid with a raised, curved lid.



Did I hesitate before downing my iced coffee? Of course not. Why?

Because the slight change didn’t negatively impact me. It was nice knowing that this could be making a positive impact on the planet.

How they (and you) can make a difference

Eliminating plastic straws, as Starbucks, Aramark Corp., Marriott and many others are doing, may not save the world. But having a mindset of sustainability and responsibility does make a world of difference, especially when it involves giant corporations and businesses.

Not only does a business decision like eliminating plastic straws draw more attention to the gross environmental impact plastic waste is wreaking on the planet, but it shows how simple, everyday decisions matter.

There has been some pushback on businesses over concerns that removing plastic straws will limit accessibility for people with disabilities, especially while at restaurants or travelling. But businesses like McDonald's are looking to try plastic straw alternatives later in 2018.

Choosing to carry a collapsible, reusable straw is just one way to prevent single-use plastic straws from ending up in the ocean or in a landfill, where they can take up 200 years to thoroughly decompose.

The ocean (and your health) can't wait

The National Park Service estimates that Americans use up to 500 million straws per day, which to visualize, is enough to fill 46,400 school buses every year. Taking the lead on reducing this usage is wise for businesses, because brands attuned to environmentally savvy consumers can market accordingly, while increasing general public awareness.

When ocean currents sweep miles upon miles of trash onto beaches, it is easy to see the damage waste is rendering on the planet versus when it is submerged.

However, the ocean is literally choking on litter. Inevitably, humans will also ingest microplastics in the food that we eat and the water that we drink.

It is our responsibility to prevent items like plastic bags, water bottles, string, and, yes, plastic straws from continuing to accumulate in this manner.

Businesses are taking a first step.

We need to continue to do the same on an individual level.

https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Travel/walt-disney-company-eliminate-plastic-straws-2019/story?id=56812530,Walt Disney Company to eliminate plastic straws and more by 2019,https://abcnews.go.com,7/26/18,"The Walt Disney Company is set to eliminate single-use plastic straws and plastic stirrers at all its owned and operated locations across the globe by mid-2019, the company announced Thursday. This includes all parks with the exception of Disney Tokyo.

That elimination amounts to a reduction of more than 175 million straws and 13 million stirrers annually, the company said.

The move comes on the heels of an announcement from Starbucks earlier this month that would phase out single-use plastic straws from its more than 28,000 stores worldwide by 2020.

“Eliminating plastic straws and other plastic items are meaningful steps in our long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship,” said Bob Chapek, Chairman, Disney Parks, Experiences, and Consumer Products. “These new global efforts help reduce our environmental footprint, and advance our long-term sustainability goals.”

For patrons of Disney hotels and Disney cruise ships, there are additional changes coming.

Over the next several years there will be a transition to refillable in-room amenities, a move that is expected to reduce plastic by 80 percent, the company estimates.

The company also said they will reduce the number of single-use plastic shopping bags in owned and operated parks and on cruise ships, offering guests the option to purchase reusable bags.

“Disney has always been inspired by nature -- and it is a uniquely powerful brand that inspires, educates, and entertains, all at the same time,” said Dr. M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, a non-profit with which Disney has collaborated on environmental and sustainability initiatives.

“Today’s announcement is more than about reducing single-use plastic waste, it’s also about showing millions of kids and adults from around the world the many ways we can change our daily habits to care for the oceans and protect nature that sustains us all,"" Sanjayan said. ""It also builds on Disney’s longstanding commitment to conservation and environmental stewardship, a legacy that stretches from the highlands of Peru to the islands of the South Pacific.”

In addition to the Walt Disney Company and Starbucks, McDonald's announced in June that it would scrap plastic straws from restaurant locations in the U.K. and Ireland and replace them with paper straws, starting in September. Vail Resorts, owner of Northstar, Heavenly and Kirkwood at Lake Tahoe and sister resorts in Colorado, Utah, British Columbia, Vermont and the Midwest, has also banned plastic straws.

The Walt Disney Company is the parent company of ABC News."
https://www.wideopencountry.com/should-plastic-straws-be-banned/,Should Plastic Straws Be Banned? These Companies Think So,https://www.wideopencountry.com,7/26/18,"If you've seen the news or spend five minutes on social media, you would know that Starbucks is at the forefront of the plastic straws ban and are changing the disposable plastic straw game. Starting this Fall, customers in Starbucks locations around Seattle will be the first to try out their newest cup design to rid the coffee chain of drinking straws. The strawless lids are almost like an adult sippy cup, but Frap drinkers don't have to worry, their whip is still safe, with Starbucks offering straws for these drinks only. In total, the chain will be eliminating more than 1 billion plastic straws per year. That's pretty impressive.

But how does something so small become such a big problem? And why is everyone getting rid of straws now?

The reason behind it is bigger than you think. Single-use plastic straws are rarely recycled and cannot break down on their own. Eventually, the plastic makes their way into the landfills or oceans. According to the World Economic Forum, there is over 150 million metric tons of plastic in the ocean. And scientists are predicting that in 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish if we keep this up. That's terrifying.

Plastic is also deadly in the oceans for marine life (remember the picture of the sea turtle with the straw stuck up its nose?). Not only is plastic a choking hazard, plastic releases BPA when it starts to break into smaller pieces. A recent study has shown that BPA can be carcinogenic and mess with our hormones.

Why The Straw

A post shared by GreenSeas Trust ?? (@greenseas.trust) on Jul 25, 2018 at 8:46am PDT

For one, straws are found in almost every single restaurant, fast food location and any other place that serves drinks. It's a small step, but environmental organizations say there is a deeper meaning to the ban.

""Our straw campaign is not really about straws,"" said Dune Ives, the executive director of Lonely Whale, the organization that led the straw ban movement in Seattle. ""It's about pointing out how prevalent single-use plastics are in our lives, putting up a mirror to hold us accountable. We've all been asleep at the wheel.""

Today the straw, tomorrow perhaps the plastic bag (which California banned back in 2014). There is no nationwide ban in the United States yet for either of these items, however, chains and small businesses are taking the lead to rid more plastic pollution from getting into our oceans.

Businesses Taking a Stand

Below are some of America's big companies taking a stand.

Disney

A post shared by Disney parks and news (@disneyparksandnews) on Jul 26, 2018 at 12:08pm PDT

Mickey and Minnie are joining the straw ban with a plan to""eliminate single-use plastic straws and plastic stirrers at all owned and operated locations across the globe by mid-2019."" The change will cut down 175 million straws and 13 million stirrers annually.

Aramark

The company which oversees dining in schools, hospitals, offices and sports venues will switch over to eco-friendly straws by 2022.

Starbucks

A post shared by Starbucks Coffee ? (@starbucks) on Jul 3, 2018 at 9:56am PDT

The coffee giant has pledged to get rid of plastic straws internationally by 2020. Frappuccinos will come with a compostable straw.

McDonald's

McDonald's has set a goal to transform all its cups, straws and boxes to renewable or recycled sources by 2025.

American Airlines

Starting this month the airlines will be removing straws and stirrers from all their lounges and serve their drinks with an eco-friendly straw and wood stir stick. Then in November in-flight stir sticks will be turned into a bamboo alternative.

Royal Caribbean

A post shared by Santaiveus Ray (@santaiveus) on Jul 23, 2018 at 12:56pm PDT

The cruise line has pledged that all 50 ships in its fleet will be free of plastic straws by the end of 2018. This past year they have been operating under a ""by request only"" policy for their plastic straws.

As of now, these are the biggest names that have made announcements, but that doesn't mean that any small company or store can't make a big difference. Even people at home can keep metal straws, reusable straws or biodegradable alternatives in their purse or wallet whenever they go out. Every small step helps keep plastic waste out."
https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/disney-becomes-latest-major-company-ban-plastic-straws-n895041,Disney becomes latest major company to ban plastic straws,https://www.nbcnews.com,7/27/18,"MIAMI — The Walt Disney Co. has announced it will stop using single-use plastic straws and plastic stirrers at all of its locations.

Disney officials said in a news release Thursday that the policy will be in place by mid-2019 and is part of the company's ""long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship.""

The plan will eliminate more than 175 million straws and 13 million stirrers annually, the company said.

Disney is the latest in a line of companies and cities that have banned plastic straws due to concerns about ocean pollution. Earlier this month, a ban on plastic straws took effect in Seattle.

Since then, Starbucks and Marriott announced plastic straws and stirrers would be removed from their businesses. San Francisco is in the process of enacting a ban on straws and other plastic items, which would begin next July 1.

Disney also announced it will transition to refillable in-room amenities in hotels and cruise ships over the next few years."
